<p>Hi, my name is Eduardo Lávaque (A.K.A. Eduán or Greduan) and I am a hobby programmer and I specialize in clean designs and modular code. I’ve been coding since around 2009 or so, which means I know about the developer world but since I’ve been switching the language I code in a lot I don’t have one language which I’m an expert at.</p>

<p>I am a blogger, an aspiring full stack developer and software engineer, a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a> advocate, (inactive) moderator for the s2Member forums and an overall thinker. A lot of stuff goes on inside my head every day.</p>

<p>I love Free Software and I also like contributing to Free Software. I’m always on the lookout for new exciting stuff that’s useful.</p>

<p>Right now my focus is on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a><a href="http://clojure.org/clojurescript">(Script)</a> and <a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a>.</p>

<p>I am a gamer when I can. I’m on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/greduan/">Steam</a> and on <a href="http://www.desura.com/members/greduan">Desura</a> and other places that don’t matter much.</p>

<p>Now let’s check some info about my website:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It was built using DocPad, the Node.js based static website generator.</li>
	<li>It was then run through some Grunt tasks in order to minify it as much as possible.</li>
	<li>It is being hosted by GitHub Pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to contact me for whatever reason please go to my <a href="/contact.html">Contact Me</a> page.</p>
