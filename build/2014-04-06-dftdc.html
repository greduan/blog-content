<p>So this is something like an official announcement. The original announcement
can be found on this GitHub issue:
<a href="https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/821#issuecomment-38612150">https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/821#issuecomment-38612150</a></p>
<p>That&#39;s it. I&#39;m super lazy so I&#39;m just linking to the original. lol</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>This no longer applies. Ben has found a way to reignite my interest in it.  And
since now I spend much more time in Node.js DocPad is a big focus point for me.</p>
