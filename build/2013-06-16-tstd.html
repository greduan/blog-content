<p>Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.</p>
<p>I switched to <a href="http://docpad.org">DocPad</a>, the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>
based static website generator. It&#39;s a static website generator but if you wish
it can be completely dynamic.</p>
<p>I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using <a href="http://coffeekup.org/">CoffeeKup</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</a> as templating languages and normal
JavaScript for the <code>.js</code> files. And I am using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for
the CSS, of course.</p>
<p>Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that&#39;s cool.</p>
<p>That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)</p>
