<p>Yay I made another part of my website! :D</p>
<p>Just thought at some point something like this might come in handy so I made
this website.</p>
<p>Can be found here: <a href="http://projects.greduan.com">http://projects.greduan.com</a></p>
<p>It is also found in the list of links in my home page.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have all of my projects, as you may notice, but it is a list of those
that I personally think would benefit others and that are standalone from
another application, like DocPad or MetalSmith.</p>
<p>Of course this list may change and also the requirements that I have for me to
put them on there, but we&#39;ll see...</p>
