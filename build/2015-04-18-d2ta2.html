<p>So first of all, I&#39;m sorry that I haven&#39;t written any blog posts in the last few
months.  I don&#39;t need to apologize, but I feel like doing it.  If you felt you
deserved an apology, I don&#39;t see why but I already apologized, so there.</p>
<p>OK so I&#39;m just gonna give you a quick update of what&#39;s happened in these months.</p>
<p>Baiscally, in December I started a move which didn&#39;t end until the 26th of
December or something like that.  During that time I had no internet, why?
Cause I had messed up my Arch Linux install, but I didn&#39;t have time to
reinstall, so yeah I was stuck without internet or a laptop for almost a month.</p>
<p>Then the first of January of 2015 or something like that I got internet access.
I spent one week debating whether I should install Arch again (cause I was tired
of it) or if I should go with something new.  I wanted to install *BSD but I had
trouble so in the end I went with the <a href="https://crux.nu">CRUX</a> Linux distro.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve been using CRUX for 4 months, until yesterday when I installed OpenBSD.</p>
<p>Today I&#39;ve been having fun discovering OpenBSD.  I&#39;ll soon have a blog post
about my experience with OpenBSD.</p>
