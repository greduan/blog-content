<p>My blog got a new URL! No longer hosted on GitHub pages, is is now being hosted
by my DigitalOcean server.</p>
<p>The way the website works now <a href="http://greduan.com">http://greduan.com</a> is my index page where I put
links to some profiles and to my blog, which is available under
<a href="http://blog.greduan.com">http://blog.greduan.com</a>.</p>
<p>That is all. Hope you like the changes! This will certainly make it easier for
me to do stuff with my website.</p>
