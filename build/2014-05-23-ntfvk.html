<p>I actually found this out while looking at another person&#39;s vimrc while looking
for some good Unite config, cause I&#39;m not really comfortable with advanced VimL,
which Unite for sure uses.</p>
<p>The specific lines are these:
<a href="https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580">https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580</a></p>
<p>This gave me an awesome hint, which is that you can actually set a key blank so
that by itself it does nothing but with an extra key it does something. In this
case it&#39;s the space key. And also that you could alias a key to another value.</p>
<p>So now I use it like this in my vimrc (changes I haven&#39;t pushed yet though, at
the time of writing):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-vim">nm &lt;space&gt; [space]
nn [space] &lt;NOP&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And a lot of my filesystem and buffer plugins use these keybinds. I may even set
it up eventually so that it completely replaces my leader key, which I honestly
don&#39;t use much anyway, nowadays.</p>
<p>Hope that helps. :)</p>
<p>Also, if you know exactly how this works please explain or point out to me where
I can find an explanation. Would really love to understand this aliasing-like
feature. Thanks! :)</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Posted a question on StackOverflow and it seems it&#39;s nothing too special. Still a neat trick though: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940">http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940</a></p>
