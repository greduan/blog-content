<p>I just figured out a cool trick to check when you installed your current Arch
Linux install.</p>
<p>All you have to do is check the logs for pacman which can be found at
<code>/var/log/pacman.log</code>.  Go to the top of the file and look at the date.</p>
<p>Looks like my current install was installed at <code>2014-04-16 15:48</code>.  Longest
running install yet.</p>
<p>Of course this trick depends on the fact that the logs still exist.  If you
cleared those logs then you can&#39;t really use this trick.  Although IMO this is
one log you shouldn&#39;t delete, considering how valuable its data could be.</p>
