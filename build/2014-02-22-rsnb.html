<p>This one should be short.  But the point is, WTF.  It has always pissed me off
in anime, manga etc., even IRL, that the characters can&#39;t believe what&#39;s
actually happening right in front of them.</p>
<p>For example.  If in front a scientist a glowing light appeared they would say
it&#39;s not real and it can&#39;t happen, it can&#39;t be happening.  It cannot be
explained thus it has not happened and isn&#39;t happening.</p>
<p>This defies science itself.  Science is not about &quot;can it be explained?&quot;,
science is about &quot;if we do this 100 times, does it always happen the same way?&quot;.
That&#39;s science and not bullshit.  If it&#39;s happening in front of you, whether or
not you know why, whether you can explain it or not, whether you have any idea
what&#39;s going on or not, it&#39;s happening.</p>
<p>If something works every time, and it can be constantly proven a certain way,
whether it&#39;s right or not, whether it breaks some &quot;laws of physics&quot; or not, it&#39;s
happening.</p>
<p>I bet if something breaks the speed of light they&#39;ll say that&#39;s impossible
because the speed of light is unattainable except by light.  Even if it&#39;s
happening in front of them.</p>
<p>BTW, the laws of physics thing, pisses me off how they are called &quot;laws&quot;, but
they are only a set of facts that have been proven to be true most of the time,
not going to say always.  If it suddently turns out gravity repels instead of
attracting, that&#39;s not possible because laws of physics.</p>
<p>According to the Oxford English dictionary, &quot;is a theoretical principle deduced
from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of phenomena, and
expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if
certain conditions be present.&quot;</p>
<p>So it can be changed, but it seems they are set in stone and will never change
for some reason.</p>
<p>I dunno.  Just pisses me off, that is all.</p>
