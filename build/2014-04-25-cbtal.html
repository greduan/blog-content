<p>This post isn&#39;t like my love letter to Arch Linux. I actually plan to talk about
it some. lol</p>
<p>First of all. I say coming back for two reasons, one I was trying out
<a href="http://solydxk.com/">SolydXK</a> which is great! But nothing quite beats Arch for
me. Second because I wasn&#39;t on vanilla Arch, I was using ArchBang because at the
time I didn&#39;t have the time to figure out some stuff and there was the problem
with my modem giving us all trouble if we tried to reconnect to it before
rebooting it etc.</p>
<p>So yeah I&#39;m finally on vanilla Arch Linux. Feels so nice. I made a <a href="http://eduantech.com/2014/04/ialoadv1.html">blog post
about the troubles I had when installing
it</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&#39;s pretty much it. I love Arch. Here&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/sh-bootstrap">my renovated install
scripts</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I should mention I&#39;m no longer using XMonad as my WM, I&#39;m now using
<a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a> which is <em>awesome</em>.</p>
