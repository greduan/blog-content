<p>Here I&#39;ll share my experience with <a href="http://solydxk.com/">SolydXK</a>, a Debian
based semi-rolling release. I&#39;ll just try to keep it short but still providing
enough info for you to have learned something from this. I think I&#39;ve spent
almost 2 weeks with this distro.</p>
<p>This is my first taste of Debian in general, so if i point out SolydXK has
something, although it&#39;s obvious because it&#39;s a Debian distro, please excuse me.
You can contact me at my email (in the bottom) in order to point out the error.
;)</p>
<p>So let&#39;s get started! First the installation...</p>
<h2 id="the-installation">The installation</h2>
<p>I put the <a href="http://solydxk.com/homeedition/solydxk-multi-dvd/">SolydXK Multi DVD</a>
ISO into an 8GB USB using <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=23267">this
guide</a> (which is my
favorite guide BTW, as it&#39;s just a reference).</p>
<p>The installation was the most pleasant installation I&#39;ve had of any Linux
distro, even something like Ubuntu. Besides the fact it was clear on the
choices&#39; purpose, it looked nice and other things, most importantly of all for
me is that it supported the dreaded
<a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43"><code>b43</code></a> wireless card drivers,
which is a huge plus for me cause I don&#39;t have Ethernet readily available. I had
Ethernet while doing this though, and the fact it recognized it needed to
install it was nice.</p>
<p>If I don&#39;t have Ethernet though I have on my USB some firmware files readily
available to copy them where they need to go. :P</p>
<p><strong>b43 users out there, this is the best experience I&#39;ve had with this driver in
any distro.</strong></p>
<p>Kinda sad that it doesn&#39;t have a super <a href="http://forums.solydxk.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=3464">minimalistic
version</a>, which my Arch
Linux in me cries about, but I&#39;m willing to live with it.</p>
<p>Here is a <em>HUGE</em> con with this one though, maybe will get fixed in the future,
but it doesn&#39;t figure out there&#39;s other distros installed on the same HDD, and
deletes the Grub entries for those (although of course the data is untouched).</p>
<h2 id="the-general-experience">The general experience</h2>
<p>I would give this a very good rating. Nothing posed any problems really, yet.</p>
<p>To switch to the <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3 window manager</a> I just all I had to do
was install it with <code># apt-get install i3</code> and choose it from the list of setups
(at the screen where you&#39;re asked your password, one of top right icons). Very
enjoyable.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with some stuff, Firefox, Thunderbird, Flash, LibreOffice
and some other stuff. Which is fine with me since I use all of those, it does
have some other stuff I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever use though, probably.</p>
<p>The update manager is very nice. It just updated today (as I&#39;m writing this) and
it&#39;s nicer now. :)</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Very nice. If you want a rolling release Debian, I&#39;d go with this if I couldn&#39;t
use Arch for whatever reason, granted I haven&#39;t tried other Debian distros.</p>
<p>BTW, I did not explain core mechanics that you&#39;ve probably already read about,
this is just to share my experience, not really a review or anything.</p>
