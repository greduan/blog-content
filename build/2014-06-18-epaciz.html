<p>Just thought I would share this tip with you since it would have saved me some
of my time if I had this.</p>
<p>Add the following to your <code>.zshrc</code> file or whatever file it is that you want,
just make sure it&#39;s loaded by Zsh:</p>
<pre><code>autoload -U compinit
compinit
</code></pre><p>That enables auto-completion and loads it up. I&#39;m not sure why I never had it
enabled, but now it is.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t really need to do anything special anywhere else I don&#39;t think, that&#39;s
the only thing I had to fix for it to work on my computer.</p>
<p>Hope that helps. :)</p>
