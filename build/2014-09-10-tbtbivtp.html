<p>I need to document this as a reminder for myself and as a saviour blog post to
any person out there in the internet that uses Vim and Tmux.</p>
<p>Read the following blog post.  That is all I&#39;m going to say.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html">http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html</a></p>
<p>Solved a problem I&#39;ve had for years in Vim.  Thank you random internet person.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you as well, random internet person.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Thought I should probably post the solution as well:</p>
<pre><code>if &amp;term =~ &#39;256color&#39;
    &quot; disable Background Color Erase (BCE) so that color schemes
    &quot; render properly when inside 256-color tmux and GNU screen.
    &quot; see also http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html
    set t_ut=
endif&quot;
</code></pre>
