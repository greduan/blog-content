<p>I&#39;ve been thinking, and I think you should respect everyone.  No matter the
circumstances, who the person is or what they&#39;ve done.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t need to be respect for his actions, circumstances or for what he/she
has.</p>
<p>It should be respect for the fact that he/she is a human being.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement is important.  When somebody says something they say it
expecting an acknowledgement of the fact that their communication was
understood.</p>
<p>When somebody does something they do it with an expectancy of somebody they care
for or look up to to acknowledge the fact that they did that.  Think the kid who
cleans his room without anyone telling him, he wanted an acknowledgement,
whether that acknowledgement is candy, dessert, or simply gratitude for the fact
that he cleaned his room.</p>
<p>When a teen is being rebellious, he is doing it because previously he did not
get an acknowledgement for who he is, and is expecting, knowingly or
unknowingly, an acknowledgement for who he is.</p>
<p>So do try to acknowledge everyone for who they are.  You don&#39;t have to agree,
but you do need to acknowledge, for that is a human right.  (In my humble
opinion.)</p>
