<p>A couple of days ago I found out that VLC has several interfaces besides the
usual nice GUI interface.</p>
<p>In Arch Linux installing VLC also installs a couple of CLI interfaces for you.</p>
<p>For example it installs <code>nvlc</code>, which is an ncurses interface, which means you
don&#39;t need X11 to listen to that music or podcast or whatever.</p>
<p>It offers <code>cvlc</code>, which I don&#39;t know what it stands for but it allows you to
watch a video without the fancy GUI. So you do need X11 running but it doesn&#39;t
load the GUI and all that, just the video player and with some hotkeys
I imagine, when I pressed the spacebar it paused so maybe the rest work.</p>
<p>And of course it offers <code>vlc</code> which loads the normal VLC but you can give it
a path to the file or folder from the CLI.</p>
