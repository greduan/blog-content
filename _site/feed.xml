				<title>The bleeding terminal background Vim + Tmux problem</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I need to document this as a reminder for myself and as a saviour blog post to
any person out there in the internet that uses Vim and Tmux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the following blog post.  That is all I&amp;#39;m going to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html&quot;&gt;http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solved a problem I&amp;#39;ve had for years in Vim.  Thank you random internet person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps you as well, random internet person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought I should probably post the solution as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;if &amp;amp;term =~ &amp;#39;256color&amp;#39;
    &amp;quot; disable Background Color Erase (BCE) so that color schemes
    &amp;quot; render properly when inside 256-color tmux and GNU screen.
    &amp;quot; see also http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html
    set t_ut=
endif&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

				<title>Getting used to software updates</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that some years ago I used to seriously look forward to every update
that any software I was using got.  Like I&amp;#39;d read all the changelogs and I&amp;#39;d be
constantly checking to make sure there wasn&amp;#39;t an update to some piece of
software that didn&amp;#39;t update itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also a reason I got into Arch in the first place I think, besides the
minimalism and how I like to build my environment from the ground up.  The
reason being that it has a rolling release model, so all of my software is as
up-to-date as it can be.  Almost, I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t go into betas, just into
every &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; release according to the piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think using Linux, specifically Arch Linux, for several years now has
desensitised me to software updates.  Where now I I don&amp;#39;t look at &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;
update, instead I look at major updates, updates to the browser, to my text
editors, etc.  Stuff of which you have to be aware because a lot has changed
since you last used it, those kind of changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would document that I guess, there&amp;#39;s not more to this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Barebones file navigation in Vim</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is mainly a rip-off of this talk that happened on a Vim London meetup
titled &amp;quot;Bare Bones Navigation, by Kris Jenkins&amp;quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/65250028&quot;&gt;http://vimeo.com/65250028&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the slides here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krisajenkins/bare-bones-vim&quot;&gt;https://github.com/krisajenkins/bare-bones-vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ends the talk with a slide that has the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; :find&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;**
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;suffixesadd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;.java&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; :find gets better more&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nocompatible&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;wildmode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;full
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;wildmenu&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;wildignore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;*.class&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;*.pyc

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; :ls &amp;amp; :&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;b&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; :Explore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; :e scp://host/some/where/file.txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll just quickly explain those.  This post is mainly for reference for
myself but I still hope it helps you.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ve challenged myself to use only these built-in commands for a while
instead of some fancy FZF or Unite.vim or anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with &lt;code&gt;:find&lt;/code&gt;.  This command just finds whatever filename you give
it, no auto-completion just give it a filename and it&amp;#39;ll find it.  It needs for
&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; to be set to &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; for it to just find any file in the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; can get very detailed and complex, so go ahead and go
nuts on your definition.  It can also be comma separted, in case you have
specific paths you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;suffixesadd&lt;/code&gt; is for &lt;code&gt;:find&lt;/code&gt;, it allows you to skip the file extension and allow
&lt;code&gt;:find&lt;/code&gt; to still find the right files.  Set it up so you can save on some
typing.  Comma separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nocompatible&lt;/code&gt; don&amp;#39;t need to explain this one, if you&amp;#39;re using Vim just use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wildmode&lt;/code&gt; that sets up the kind of auto-completion that Vim has for the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;.
While he sets it to &lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt; I always set it to &lt;code&gt;list:longest&lt;/code&gt;, this is
preference though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wildmenu&lt;/code&gt; from what I understand makes it so that the auto-completion isn&amp;#39;t all
on one line, so that it uses several lines to show the auto-completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wildignore&lt;/code&gt; is to define files to ignore.  Set it to the files you mostly never
want to edit because only the language uses them, not the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he talks about switching buffers with &lt;code&gt;:ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:b[uffer]&lt;/code&gt;.  Use &lt;code&gt;:ls&lt;/code&gt; to
list your buffers and use &lt;code&gt;:b[uffer]&lt;/code&gt; to switch to a buffer by buffer number.
While he uses the buffer number before the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, you can also use it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;:Ex[plore]&lt;/code&gt; (which includes &lt;code&gt;:Sex[plore]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:Vex[plore]&lt;/code&gt;) and
&lt;code&gt;:e[dit]&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;:{E,Ve,Se}x[plore]&lt;/code&gt; commands open up the built-in netrw file
explorer which is a built-in plugin, which means it is not included if you use
&lt;code&gt;vim -u NONE&lt;/code&gt; in order to not load any config or plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VimCasts has a blog post about this that I suggest reading so you get familiar
with this plugin and how to use it:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/&quot;&gt;http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally &lt;code&gt;:e[dit]&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in Vim command and all that there is to it is
to give it the full path of the file you want to edit.  The path you give it is
relative to the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all on that subject.  While I&amp;#39;m on it though, I would suggest that if
you are in a setup where you can have a couple of plugins, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; suggest
you install the following plugins by Tim Pope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all, hope this helps.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Navigating in the dark</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I&amp;#39;d quickly write a couple of tips to see in the dark, besides
having good eyes but those are not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, so I mentioned this to my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://raamdev.com/&quot;&gt;Raam Dev&lt;/a&gt; and he answered
with the best explanation I could hope for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I can navigate in the dark really well too, but I think vision and time-to-night-vision plays less of a role than simply using all of your senses and being good at making accurate judgment calls about where things are, where they might be, and then using the way the limited light bounces off objects to get a better feel for the world around you and then using all of that information to build a mental image of the world you&amp;#39;re navigating. When I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, which requires walking down a short hallway outside the bedroom, I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; walk with my eyes &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;. I find that walking in the dark with my eyes closed is easier than walking with my eyes open, because then my brain does all the visualization and my eyes, which may see reflections or other objects, don&amp;#39;t fool my mind into second-guessing itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, while walking with my eyes closed, I do use my hands as &amp;quot;sensors&amp;quot;, to feel walls, the moldings on the walls, the doors, the door handles, the corners of walls, etc. All of that builds a mental image in my mind that I use to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes I asked for his permission, in case you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, seeing in the night is not all about if you can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; in the
darkness, although if you can that&amp;#39;s cool.  It&amp;#39;s mostly about making the most of
the minimal input that you have, mostly visual, because with the rest of the
senses the input is certainly not minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah, for example if I have the chance, before navigating a dark room I try
to turn on a light for a couple of seconds in order to get a very clear mental
image of where all the stuff in the room is.  After that it&amp;#39;s just about moving
through that physical space while continually updating your mental image,
essentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever tried closing your eyes and guessing how many steps it would take to be
from one end of the room to the next or ever tried navigating the house with
your eyes closed?  It&amp;#39;s sorta like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are trying to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; in an environment where you don&amp;#39;t have
enough light to see, so with the small inputs you have, just draw a mental image
of your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;#39;s recommendable to go slowly, so that if you miscalculate something
it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt, although with experience this&amp;#39;ll start happening less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thought I&amp;#39;d share that, hope this helps.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Knowing something but not registering it</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever have that moment when you realize something that you already knew?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds kinda dumb, but it is not that rare for me to realize something
that I had realized before, just never really thought about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I remember one day I watched some Hatsune Miku concert, just one song, and
I realized there was a hologram, and I was like &amp;quot;cool, they&amp;#39;ve got a hologram&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months later I watched it again and I was like &amp;quot;holy shit holograms!
Technology has gotten to that point!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one would be how I made an entire CLI app just to download a Gist&amp;#39;s
files and put them in the current directory.  Just yesterday I realized I can
just clone a Git repo of the Gist and that&amp;#39;s that.  I was thinking that the .zip
file download was the only way to go, but it isn&amp;#39;t.  I knew about the Git repo
stuff, I just never even registered it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinda short post, but just wanted to share that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A week with Emacs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have begun writing this in the 5th day of my one week with Emacs.  Since a
friend of mine was making the switch to Emacs, or at least seriously attempting
I decided to take a challenge with him where we would only use Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement was I would only use Emacs, for everything, with or without Evil
mode.  While he would use Emacs for anything that wasn&amp;#39;t coding, as using Emacs
would be a serious dent to his prductivity and he basically wouldn&amp;#39;t be
productive for a whole week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed to keep a journal of our experience with Emacs.  I haven&amp;#39;t read his so
I&amp;#39;m not sure how detailed he is with his, or how dedicated, but I don&amp;#39;t think
mine will be as detailed as his, in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to share my experience in my blog and sharing my journal in it,
along with a more detailed version of the journal I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the whole journal in a file named &lt;code&gt;emacs-journal.txt&lt;/code&gt; in my home
directory.  I won&amp;#39;t pose the whole thing here, since it would just be a screen
hog, so I&amp;#39;ll put it in a Gist, here it can be
found: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/Greduan/2f555993c1a537d8e7a5&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/Greduan/2f555993c1a537d8e7a5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you read that, come back here for a more detailed version, or just skip
the journal altogether if that&amp;#39;s what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned, if you came here for a review or a workflow blog post you may not
find what you are looking for here.  I say &amp;quot;may&amp;quot; because I am just now writing
this post and I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;ll come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I think I will mainly share differences I have noted between
Emacs and Vim, its users, the workflows found in both, how the experience was
for me, a 1-2 year only-Vim user, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Emacs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a Vim user that can fluently think in motions and text objects, why the hell
would he want to be a traitor and switch to Emacs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well one, as I said earlier, it was a challenge in order to help my friend
switch to Emacs so that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be alone and all of that, because being
the only one that uses a certain tool is kinda sad, I should know, I&amp;#39;m the only
one in my team that uses Vim, everyone else uses some IDE like PhpStorm (yuck!).
Also one of the two that uses Linux as the OS instead of OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, I am naturally interested in Emacs, seeing how I am the user of the
archrival editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recently found &lt;a href=&quot;http://input.fontbureau.com/&quot;&gt;this font package&lt;/a&gt;, but
I can&amp;#39;t really use it very effectively in Vim so I thought I&amp;#39;d check out Emacs.
For the record I haven&amp;#39;t done anything with this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK let&amp;#39;s get to the meat of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About what?  Everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring observation for me is the different kinds of users that use
Emacs and Vim.  Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like in Vim the user makes the changes fast, while in Emacs the user
takes a bit of time in order to code some kind of solution for Emacs to do it
for him.  In Emacs that piece of code forever remains in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; file
if you want and you can use it whenever, while in Vim if you want to make the
change again you just do the motion of keystrokes again, or record a macro and
save that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:  Do remember that I&amp;#39;ve only seriously used Emacs for 5 days at this point,
so I definitely don&amp;#39;t know the workflow of a 10 year Emacs user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Emacs you can customize I think pretty much literally anything.  I don&amp;#39;t mean
the figurative literally BTW, I mean the literal literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vim you can customize to a great extent your text editing experience, but you
can only customize your environment experience to the limits imposed by Vim&amp;#39;s
options and settings.  Of course you can probably get very clever and do some
very interesting stuff to customize Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Note: Now the next day, the 6th day.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the users have very dfferent mindsets.  While in Emacs it is &amp;quot;how can I
automate this?&amp;quot; in Vim it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;how many keystrokes can I find a way to skip?&amp;quot;.
This is brought about by the differences between Emacs and Vim, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The ergonomics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just going to go ahead and say it.  In my opinion, Emacs&amp;#39; default keybindings
&lt;strong&gt;suck&lt;/strong&gt;.  Being a Vim user I found it super uncomfortable to have to go and find
the Ctrl and Alt keys constantly.  Maybe it has to do with how I press the keys,
maybe not, I press Ctrl using my left pinky and Alt using my left thumb.  I don&amp;#39;t
feel like those keys are very strange but maybe they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I did not switch Caps lock and Ctrl, neither will I do it.  I think I
tried doing it at some point for Tmux, as I head suggestions to do that, and
remap the prefix to &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-a&lt;/code&gt;.  I did not like it, felt unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to use something like God-mode, which feels like less of a
hack, however I haven&amp;#39;t gotten used to using it every time I can so I haven&amp;#39;t
gotten much benefit from it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes.  Ergonomics.  Freakin&amp;#39; work on them please, at least make the keys more
natural.  &lt;code&gt;M-b&lt;/code&gt; is exceptionally unnatural to press when you use your thumb to
press Alt, again that may be my own fault though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The damn tabs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it SO HARD to configure how tabs work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had tabs sorta figured out, just make everything be a hard tab and you&amp;#39;ll be
fine, but that doesn&amp;#39;t work when you&amp;#39;re working with Lisp, because Lisp and
hard tabs are the bane of good code formatting.  But IMO tabs work everywhere
else better than spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to go through what I&amp;#39;ve tried, you can probably see that in my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d&quot;&gt;dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; (that&amp;#39;s how
you do shameless plugs), but it wasn&amp;#39;t a pleasant experience.  In Vim it&amp;#39;s not
pleasant either but at least it&amp;#39;s straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Elisp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elisp is cool.  Configuring an entire editor with it is a concept I enjoy
thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Emacs is a HUGE piece of software, compared to Vim that is, it has a TON
of code, Elisp and C code, all to give you a great piece of software that you
can configure as much as you want without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Light Table is not the next Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.greduan.com/2013/11/lttne.html&quot;&gt;a post I did
previously&lt;/a&gt;, I was very excited
about Light Table and clojureScript and all that jazz back then and I didn&amp;#39;t
really know all that much about Emacs except what I had heard about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Light Table is not the next Emacs, not even remotely close, it doesn&amp;#39;t
even work inside the CLI so that already makes it very different. lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The package management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t write a lot about it, I just want to say it&amp;#39;s not an ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/&quot;&gt;really great post about this
subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent time with both &lt;code&gt;package.el&lt;/code&gt; and El-get, I personally prefer
El-get so far, but &lt;code&gt;package.el&lt;/code&gt; is still really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post probably doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of flow, maybe.  It was written over
several days and it was basically just a rant, A.K.A. &amp;quot;say whatever you have on
your mind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s quite noticeably I quickly ran out of stuff to say.  lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, there was no Evil-mode mentioned huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since the 6th day I started using Vim for coding again, becaues Emacs was
too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A small project is not the same as a big project</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s quite an obvious statement isn&amp;#39;t it?  The one in the title.  Well
I didn&amp;#39;t learn this until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain myself, and how I&amp;#39;m not dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small project you can get a skeleton for in like an hour, you spend a bit of
time brainstorming features and how you can simplify it and in an hour you have
a skeleton, in 15 mins you have a project ready to start working on, you&amp;#39;ve
figured out the README the license etc., you just have to start making it now,
and that takes like 3 hours or less if you&amp;#39;re good, depends on the project of
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a big project you don&amp;#39;t plan out quite as much, since that&amp;#39;s
a bad idea to do at the start, instead you setup some tests (if you work Agile),
you make some decisions on what to start with etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 hours, you&amp;#39;re not nearly done with the big project, while the small
project you&amp;#39;re at least halfway there if not done already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re used to small projects, like I am, a bigger or slightly bigger project
may make you feel slow, at least it made me feel slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just kinda want to say that&amp;#39;s probably normal and not something to worry
about, if you haven&amp;#39;t finished your idea in 6 months, maybe start worrying.  lol&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A projects page!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yay I made another part of my website! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thought at some point something like this might come in handy so I made
this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.greduan.com&quot;&gt;http://projects.greduan.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also found in the list of links in my home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t have all of my projects, as you may notice, but it is a list of those
that I personally think would benefit others and that are standalone from
another application, like DocPad or MetalSmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this list may change and also the requirements that I have for me to
put them on there, but we&amp;#39;ll see...&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Several VLC interfaces</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I found out that VLC has several interfaces besides the
usual nice GUI interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arch Linux installing VLC also installs a couple of CLI interfaces for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example it installs &lt;code&gt;nvlc&lt;/code&gt;, which is an ncurses interface, which means you
don&amp;#39;t need X11 to listen to that music or podcast or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers &lt;code&gt;cvlc&lt;/code&gt;, which I don&amp;#39;t know what it stands for but it allows you to
watch a video without the fancy GUI. So you do need X11 running but it doesn&amp;#39;t
load the GUI and all that, just the video player and with some hotkeys
I imagine, when I pressed the spacebar it paused so maybe the rest work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course it offers &lt;code&gt;vlc&lt;/code&gt; which loads the normal VLC but you can give it
a path to the file or folder from the CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Enable `pass` auto-completion in Zsh</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would share this tip with you since it would have saved me some
of my time if I had this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file or whatever file it is that you want,
just make sure it&amp;#39;s loaded by Zsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;autoload -U compinit
compinit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That enables auto-completion and loads it up. I&amp;#39;m not sure why I never had it
enabled, but now it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t really need to do anything special anywhere else I don&amp;#39;t think, that&amp;#39;s
the only thing I had to fix for it to work on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Acknowledgements in communication</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to talk about acknowledgements, what they are, how they work and why
they are important.  May be a short or long post.  I&amp;#39;ll say &amp;quot;ack&amp;quot; whenever
I mean &amp;quot;acknowledgement&amp;quot; because that&amp;#39;s a long word to type over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK let&amp;#39;s get started.  First, what is an ack? An ack is something said or done
to inform someone that his statement or action has been noted, understood and
received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can be &amp;quot;OK&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Got it&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ah, I see&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I understand&amp;quot; etc. This lets the
person know you got his or her communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions can also be an ack, for example applause, you are acking a person&amp;#39;s
performance and also communicating that you liked it.  A thumbs up.  A nod.  All
of these are acks.  They convey different meanings along with the ack as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a person that gives good acks makes you feel good.  You like speaking with
a person that gives good acks.  You do not like speaking with a person that does
not give good acks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acks can be messed up in several ways, too.  Like for example, your ack is not
good enough, your ack is not heard or you don&amp;#39;t even give an ack.  This leaves
the other person hanging, the person is left feeling insecure over the fact that
you heard him, most often these people will repeat themselves to make sure they
were understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also give too much ack.  Cannot think of an example for that one, but it
can happen.  Leaves the person overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also give the wrong kind of ack.  Ever been bothered by someone
repeating something over and over?  Did you say &amp;quot;OK I got it!&amp;quot; in an irritated
or angry manner?  That is the wrong kind of ack.  Yes, you are letting the
person know you heard him, but since you said it in a bad manner the person
cannot really be sure you heard him, since you may have just said it to shut the
person up.  Plus it leaves a bad feeling in the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also give an ack for when something is finished.  You were ordered or
asked to do something, you ack that letting the person you understood and will
do it and then when you finish doing it you let the person know you did it.
This is a more complete ack, in a sense, because you are letting the person know
that his order was carried on, that means his communication was heard and also
the person no longer has to continue worrying if you did it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of tricks and workarounds and facts about acks.  You will
learn them all with experience, I am just sharing what I currently know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out if you give good acks.  It is an important piece of communication,
without which communication is a huge pain in the bum.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Arch Linux font tip(s)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would share something that has been very useful to me recently,
and that is some Arch Linux font stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;#39;s talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle%2Bfonts&quot;&gt;Infinality-bundle+fonts&lt;/a&gt;.  This is SO useful!
It&amp;#39;s basically some pre-configured font settings and fonts that make your Arch
Linux font rendering so nice.  If you want a real quick plug-and-play font
config you can use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice and all but I didn&amp;#39;t like how many downloads I had to make in each
&lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;/code&gt;, granted I don&amp;#39;t think they were too many but my internet is not
so fast that I don&amp;#39;t care about the size of my downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To uninstall it I had to, IIRC remove the &amp;#39;infinality-bundle&amp;#39; repository from my
&lt;code&gt;pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, then I had to manually uninstall all the fonts and stuff
from this bundle.  There&amp;#39;s probably an easy way to do this but I am not aware of
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so that&amp;#39;s one solution.  There is another one which I really like since it
works quite well which can be found in this blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaysonrowe.blogspot.mx/2013/04/font-configuration-in-arch-linux.html&quot;&gt;From the mind of a nerd:
Font Configuration in Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed his steps and it works quite well.  Some websites for some reason
don&amp;#39;t have font smoothing but they are not many.  I did not follow the settings
he has on XFCE, because I don&amp;#39;t have XFCE installed but if I did that it would
probably work flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution allows me to not install anything extra and still have nice fonts
so I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope these tips help you out someday. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My slow switch to Emacs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to come out and say that I like Emacs.  As a platform, not as an
editor mind you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil&quot;&gt;Evil&lt;/a&gt; as is probably to be expected.  I have become so
accustomed to Vim that without some sort of Vim emulation I cannot survive in
another editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I&amp;#39;m using Evil and I am slowly, but surely, using Emacs more and
more, making little modifications that make it nicer and and more comfortable
for me.  I&amp;#39;ll soon probably have to write a couple of plugins in order to
achieve some Vim behaviour I like though, that&amp;#39;ll be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d&quot;&gt;my dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; have all my configs, can&amp;#39;t promise they&amp;#39;ll be
as up-to-date as they sometimes have been, because there are lots of changes
going on and that would be a very big amount of insignificant commits if
I committed everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just wanted to share that. If I ever need to use Vim in a remote server or
for pair programming, I&amp;#39;m open and if I need to use Emacs I&amp;#39;m also open, unless
it&amp;#39;s Emacs without Evil, in which case I am closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have NO clue how Emacs users could use &lt;code&gt;C-f&lt;/code&gt; for moving right by one, &lt;code&gt;C-b&lt;/code&gt;
for back one, &lt;code&gt;C-n&lt;/code&gt; to move down one and &lt;code&gt;C-p&lt;/code&gt; to go up one.  It&amp;#39;s crazy, their
hands move ALL OVER the keyboard, and they say it&amp;#39;s fine.  Whoever says that is
either bored or crazy or both.  Or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all.  Feel free to share anything you want on my dotfiles by forking
them or what have you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New blog!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My blog got a new URL! No longer hosted on GitHub pages, is is now being hosted
by my DigitalOcean server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the website works now &lt;a href=&quot;http://greduan.com&quot;&gt;http://greduan.com&lt;/a&gt; is my index page where I put
links to some profiles and to my blog, which is available under
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.greduan.com&quot;&gt;http://blog.greduan.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all. Hope you like the changes! This will certainly make it easier for
me to do stuff with my website.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My take on Vim vs. Emacs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to create any kind of flamewar or anything, this is just my
take on the real differences, technical or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the fact that they are completely different things if you look
at them, for very different publics. Emacs is the platform, Vim is the editor.
Vim could never beat Emacs as a platform, Emacs couldn&amp;#39;t beat Vim as an editor.
And those are facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim has the most impressive things in it in order to edit text in the most
impressive ways possible. You see some Vim users and they just move ALL around
the place, sometimes it&amp;#39;s even hard to see their cursor from their speed.
Sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to figure out what they are doing because they are doing it
so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs has the most impressive things in it in order to be able to basically do
whatever the hell you want in it. Users can really have everything running on
Emacs if they so desired. Here&amp;#39;s a short list of some of the stuff Emacs can do
by default:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tetris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async OMG!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim has trouble with async, but its community has found several ways to achieve
async in Vim, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim&quot;&gt;vimproc.vim&lt;/a&gt; for example. I think there are several ways
anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs handles async like a champ since the moment you install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim startups in like 2 tenths of a second, with several plugins installed, for
me. Practically &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;code&gt;vim -u NONE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs, with &lt;code&gt;emacs -q&lt;/code&gt; quite quick, maybe like my usual Vim config. But with my
init file it takes one or two seconds. Granted my config really has to be
cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim uses VimL, which is slow, quirky and not all that powerful, although some
people have done some really cool stuff with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs uses Elisp, a variation of Common Lisp. It is a Lisp, what more is there
to say? It&amp;#39;s awesome automatically&lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure.org/&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is an interesting fact about Emacs. It technically has all the power
and potential needed to make it as good as Vim at editing text, to an extent,
except its interface sucks and isn&amp;#39;t modal. There&amp;#39;s a thing called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil&quot;&gt;Evil&lt;/a&gt;
that tries to fix that. It does quite a good job, but for the advanced Vim
users, like Drew Neil and Tim Pope, I don&amp;#39;t really think it cuts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim users are, as bling once said, tenacious. You will most often find something
be implemented in Vim first before it&amp;#39;s implemented in Emacs, no matter how
hacky or dirty the method is, they will most certainly do it first. Except stuff
that is just plain impossible in Vim. Like this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity&quot;&gt;https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how I see it. I&amp;#39;d really love to see Emacs as a platform that runs Vim
on top of it and that would practically be the best text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I said anything that&amp;#39;s wrong or that is not exactly right, please edit this
post and submit a pull request in order to fix and point out what&amp;#39;s wrong:

				<title>You need to understand JavaScript callbacks</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here I will share something I realized I learnt only after learning it. That is
the fact that if you want to program fluently in JS you need to understand and
know by heart JavaScript&amp;#39;s callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to point out that I did know callbacks were important, but I didn&amp;#39;t
realize just how powerless you are when programming in JS and you don&amp;#39;t know
your callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the lesson I&amp;#39;ve learned. Now I&amp;#39;m going to teach to you what callbacks
are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the definition of callback, in terms of JS. A &amp;quot;callback&amp;quot; is, in
the simplest of the English language, what to do after the function has been
executed. That is the callback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s look at the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;function x(a, callback) {
    var b = a + 5;
    return callback(a);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that code does is add &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and give them to the callback. So this
function would be used the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;x(5, function(bap){
    console.log(bap); // returns 10
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the connection that is happening? Before I go on I just want to make
a couple of points. The callback should be an anonymous function, I&amp;#39;m not sure
if this is required or not but after reading a lot of code this is the only way
that I&amp;#39;ve seen it, so I&amp;#39;m assuming it&amp;#39;s the only way possible. Please correct me
if I&amp;#39;m wrong. Secondly, the name of the argument that you use in the anonymous
function can be named anything, also the variable that you give to callback can
be named anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so to explain what is happening here, it&amp;#39;s basically running function &lt;code&gt;x()&lt;/code&gt;
which is assigning the value of &lt;code&gt;5 + 5&lt;/code&gt; to a var &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and that var &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is being
passed to the callback. The callback receives the value of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and names it
&lt;code&gt;bap&lt;/code&gt; (in this example) and then logs to the console the value of &lt;code&gt;bap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re as simple as that, but I never saw an explanation like this. I did
understand that callbacks were what was done after the function was executed and
the results were available, but I never understood the process that it took in
order to give the anonymous function the value and what values were used by the
anonymous function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post helps you understand callbacks, even if just a little. Please
correct me if I said anything and please add any detail that you can. You can do
so by forking my blog and editing this blog post over at:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/greduan.github.io&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/greduan.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Neat trick for Vim keybindings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I actually found this out while looking at another person&amp;#39;s vimrc while looking
for some good Unite config, cause I&amp;#39;m not really comfortable with advanced VimL,
which Unite for sure uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific lines are these:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave me an awesome hint, which is that you can actually set a key blank so
that by itself it does nothing but with an extra key it does something. In this
case it&amp;#39;s the space key. And also that you could alias a key to another value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I use it like this in my vimrc (changes I haven&amp;#39;t pushed yet though, at
the time of writing):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot; data-lang=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;nm &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;space&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; [space]
nn [space] &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;NOP&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lot of my filesystem and buffer plugins use these keybinds. I may even set
it up eventually so that it completely replaces my leader key, which I honestly
don&amp;#39;t use much anyway, nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you know exactly how this works please explain or point out to me where
I can find an explanation. Would really love to understand this aliasing-like
feature. Thanks! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posted a question on StackOverflow and it seems it&amp;#39;s nothing too special. Still a neat trick though: &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Just switch to UTC</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll just say it right now, I hate timezones.  And daylight saving time, it can
go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the fact that anywhere I am in the world (not near the poles) I know 8:00
the sun is up and 20:00 the sun is down.  That&amp;#39;s all fine and dandy. But I don&amp;#39;t
like and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever like calculating timezones.  &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; with
places there&amp;#39;s daylight saving time, where I gotta take into account if it&amp;#39;s on
or out daylight saving time, plus my own, and they start and end at different
times, it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have meetings every Monday at 21:00 (9:00 PM) UTC.  At this time we all spend
some time chatting. For me that means 3 different hours at which the meeting can
happen, because of timezones and daylight saving time. It can happen from 15:00
to 17:00.  And it was a PITA to ask when it&amp;#39;s starting, until I started using
UTC as the reference for the time at which it&amp;#39;s going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at what time is for a moment. We could keep track of it or not care
at all, in fact if we didn&amp;#39;t care at all maybe some stuff would be better,
maybe.  We&amp;#39;d use the sun and the moon to track the time, instead of saying &amp;quot;Meet
you at 12:00 PM on the hall&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;Meet you in the hall when the sun is at
it&amp;#39;s hottest&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s something we can easily feel, although we&amp;#39;d be off by
around one hour, it wouldn&amp;#39;t really matter because our civilization would be
VERY different, where preciseness wouldn&amp;#39;t matter that much, and when it does
maybe we just stick together or set more secure times, like when the sun starts
setting or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we didn&amp;#39;t have time we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to coordinate time
globally, only locally where everyone knows naturally in how much time the sun
will go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So time, IMO, has it&amp;#39;s most use when used globally. But the way we use it today
it complicates stuff way too much!  Assuming there are no timezones, it&amp;#39;s not
that hard but still a hassle.  With our current timezones system before I do
anything with planning times I need to understand at what times in my timezone
it&amp;#39;s day during the other timezones and find somewhere where they overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we used UTC it would be very simple, one side says &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m available from 12:00
to 20:00&amp;quot; and the other side knows exactly what time that is and it can say &amp;quot;OK
let&amp;#39;s talk at 16:00&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing with timezones, we work at different days if on opposite sides of
the planet. Right now it&amp;#39;s the 21st for me, but for Sydney, Australia it&amp;#39;s the
22nd. Look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bevry/website/compare/8b1506f9d7...9271a70a96&quot;&gt;commit
diff&lt;/a&gt;. These
commits happened in practically the same 10 minutes, but because of timezones
Git detected one of these commits being one day later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just all agree &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt; to start using UTC, drop the notion that
before PM it&amp;#39;s morning and after PM it&amp;#39;s afternoon, drop the notion that at 8AM
the sun rises and 8PM the sun drops and just learn the UTC time for these events
in our own area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all I have to say and this opinion won&amp;#39;t change.  Different languages
OK, it&amp;#39;s different cultures, but different times?  Come on.  We&amp;#39;re all humans in
one damn planet, I&amp;#39;m sure we can come to agree on the time.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My experience with the BSPWM and Sxhkd</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;#39;m going to, as you might have guessed, talk about the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/&quot;&gt;BPSPM&lt;/a&gt; window manager along with its
partner tool that&amp;#39;s almost impossible to live without,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd&quot;&gt;Sxhkd&lt;/a&gt; a simple X hotkey daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may have trouble understanding the concept of a tree structure for
the windows in a window manager, but basically, every window is inside
a container, that container can act as a window or as a container of two other
containers, each of which can act like a window or as a container of two other
containers, each of which... etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows for very complex, advanced and simple to do organization of your
windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, TBH I can only work with these kinds of editors because they&amp;#39;re the
only ones that make sense for my workflow, in which almost no virtual desktop is
used for the same thing every time. The idea of a master window doesn&amp;#39;t really
work for me TBH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However because of this tree like structure for organizing the windows it only
has two layouts, monospaced, which basically only has one window on the screen
no mater how many there are on the desktop or tiled, which allows you to take
advantage of all of this crazyness that is a tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i3 has a similiar structure, i3 describes it&amp;#39;s structure as a tree, BSPWM
describes it&amp;#39;s own as a binary space, actually it&amp;#39;s description is &amp;quot;A tiling
window manager based on binary space partitioning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my experience with it, super nice for everything except setting up
Dzen2, my preferred program to use as a bar with my window managers. Had to
spend quite a bit of time with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have experience with the shell you&amp;#39;ll probably notice right away why
Sxhkd is more powerful than something like xmodmap:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/blob/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/blob/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find all of my BSPWM config here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/config/bspwm&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/config/bspwm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a little bit in the &lt;code&gt;.zprofile&lt;/code&gt; file:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/blob/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/zprofile&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/blob/84adea6901215c9e41a5ce2dae77e0406bce734a/zprofile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a nice GIF by windelicato about why BSPWM:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windelicato/dotfiles/master/why_bspwm.gif&quot;&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windelicato/dotfiles/master/why_bspwm.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final verdict, it&amp;#39;s nice but still in the trial stage, may go back to i3...&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Write down the day ahead of you</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just sharing a neat little trick I&amp;#39;ve setup for myself to keep myself
focused on what I should do during the day, or atleast help keep myself focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one of these notepads, that don&amp;#39;t really count as notepads. You can rip
off each page and the pages are held together by a red plastic which was once
sticky but is now dry. If you don&amp;#39;t get what I&amp;#39;m talking about just think of it
as any other small notepad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m doing is, I wake up, I turn computer on, and before doing anything else
I write down in this notepad, in one page usually, what I gotta do for the day.
So I write at the top in big letters the title of the subject, like if a client
is named &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot; I write in big letters &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot; at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I make a list of the stuff that I have to do. I separate each item with
a dash (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;) and I leave like 1 or 2 centimeters of space to the left of the
dash (for Americans and UK people that&amp;#39;s around 1 inch). This space is in order
to be able to communicate stuff to myself with symbols. Little bit on that
later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s a list of stuff that I wrote for myself for my client&amp;#39;s site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Bob:

- performance meta &amp;#39;title&amp;#39;
- fix videos centering
/ homepage SEO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add that extra space to the left of the dashes yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what this means for me is that there are reminders, two of them are todo and
one of them is done. &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; is todo, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. That&amp;#39;s all I do and it keeps me on track. And if I think of stuff to
add to this, I just do. And I do it by least time-consuming to most
time-consuming. At the end of the day I just rip this page off, or scroll to the
next one, if there&amp;#39;s something leftover I write in the page for tomorrow. This
of course can be done, before or after sleeping. I tend to do before, but after
works just as well I find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one thing with this is that you do NOT need to detail exactly what you want
to do. Just little reminders that tell you what you need to do. Preferably make
it one-liners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s with the space to the left? That&amp;#39;s just for symbols. I&amp;#39;ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m working on that or I got some part of it done but I need to stop for
&lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; reason, I add a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;. This tells me I started on it but didn&amp;#39;t finish.
If I later start again I add a &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea, you can use any symbol you like, I just like using symbols
that make sense for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, use symbols that make sense for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What the gut feeling is for me</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that the gut feeling works different for everyone, and it seems
women have a different kind of gut feeling called a &amp;quot;woman&amp;#39;s instinct&amp;quot; or
something like that. But I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about my experience with my gut feeling
and how maybe you could start using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in my experience, the gut feeling has not been what I feel in my gut, so
let&amp;#39;s start by putting that out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the gut feeling for me has been an interesting experience. The way my gut
feeling coems for me is the first thought that comes to mind pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am better at judging people I just met by gut feeling than by analysation. The
first time I meet someone I trust my gut feeling as what I work off from to
analyze. No matter how nice or how insensitive a person seems, it&amp;#39;s the gut
feeling that tells me if they could be good friends, bad friends, or the kind
that seems like a good friend but screws you over behind your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I meet someone and they&amp;#39;re very charming and all, but something
at the back of my head pokes at me like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this person&amp;quot;, I will trust
that poke, because most of the time it has been right, and if it was wrong,
there&amp;#39;s always a second time, the analysation stage. BTW, one of the reasons
I don&amp;#39;t hangout with as much people as I probably should, gut feeling telling me
no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just meeting people. Eating food works similarly, except this one
could save my life quite directly. I have never eaten something that gives me
a bad feeling. I don&amp;#39;t judge meat by how it looks, I judge it by my body saying
yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention at this point, gut feeling is not always everything. You know,
you&amp;#39;re not gonna cheat on your wife or girlfriend because your body is saying
yes, it&amp;#39;s times like these that the mind has to come in and put the body under
control and say &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that feeling where you just feel like you have to do
something? Or you&amp;#39;ve done it before you realize? I haven&amp;#39;t had quite an like
that experience myself, but I was witness to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Argentina there was this pizza delivery-man, he was leaving for
a delivery and had the pizza on the back, whatever. He stored the pizza and got
on the bike (a motorcycle), as he was starting it, with the most fluid movements
I remember in my life, he got off. Like 1 second later a car crashed against his
bike (lightly). Now what&amp;#39;s interesting is that the car came from nowhere, he
could not see it or hear it, I didn&amp;#39;t myself as I was facing the same general
direction he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the car crashed the guy was bewildered, he looked bewildered at least, he
had no idea what had just happened. He just got off his bike without knowing why
and a second later a car crashed against his bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, that&amp;#39;s gut feeling and your body answering without giving you
a choice. My mom experienced something similar, had she not scooted over by like
10, 20cm, a car would have hit her, this is one time she was coming out of
a cab, although I didn&amp;#39;t see this one myself, it&amp;#39;s a story she shared with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, but in the end I guess the point is, don&amp;#39;t ignore your gut
feeling. And everybody has it, those that have it more just know how or when to
listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you met a person, trust your gut feeling, it&amp;#39;ll probably something so
basic you&amp;#39;ll almost miss. For me most of my gut feelings are the first thought
in my head when I am given a choice of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A technique to remember small stuff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is to share something that I&amp;#39;ve found quite useful, and seems to work
quite consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to remember a name? And I mean one that you know, but forgot
when you need it, not one that you heard 10 years ago and there&amp;#39;s probably no
chance you&amp;#39;ll remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give you an example so that you get the idea of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was recommending to someone a certain artist, I like the artist
and all, but I couldn&amp;#39;t remember the name. I couldn&amp;#39;t remember it, I tried for
several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to do something, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eduantech.com/2014/04/wtgfifm.html&quot;&gt;trust my gut
feeling&lt;/a&gt;, turns out the gut feeling
works great for memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, what I do is ask myself &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s his name?&amp;quot; and I consider the
first things that come to mind, for this example let&amp;#39;s say the letter &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; came
to mind.  So I say, OK, that&amp;#39;s his name&amp;#39;s first letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I say, starting with &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;, what&amp;#39;s his name... &amp;quot;Toshi&amp;quot; comes to mind but
that&amp;#39;s not right.  I did notice it is closer to it though, beause it resonated
with my memory (best way I can come up to describe what I felt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided something was missing, so I repeated to myself &amp;quot;Toshi&amp;quot; over and over.
Then suddenly I realized his name was &amp;quot;Toshio&amp;quot; and I was like &amp;quot;I got it!&amp;quot;, but
I still felt like something was missing so I kept repeating &amp;quot;Toshio&amp;quot; to myself.
After 15 seconds of that I figured it out, the name I was looking for was
&amp;quot;Tokashio&amp;quot;, and I was content with that so that was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is, I went several times with the first answer that came up. This
is usually good to remember all kinds of stuff. Ever looked for what you were
talking about before you got into a heated argument? This works quite well &amp;quot;well
we were talking about ____&amp;quot;, after that most people would say &amp;quot;nah that was much
earlier&amp;quot;, maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t, work off from that and you&amp;#39;ll soon remember what it
was. Unless the argument was completely unrelated to whatever started it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope this helps. This doesn&amp;#39;t describe it very well, but in a short
amount of words it&amp;#39;s basically asking yourself &amp;quot;what is it?&amp;quot; and the first thing
that comes to mind will probably be it, and continue with it until you remember
the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a name you could go letter by letter, &amp;quot;did it start with an E?&amp;quot; if your gut
feeling says yes, then it is, then go &amp;quot;the second letter was a T I think...&amp;quot; and
continue like that until boom, you&amp;#39;ve got the whole name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend about memory but I didn&amp;#39;t mention this
technique and at some point he said &amp;quot;like in layers&amp;quot; and I thought that was the
best way to describe this technique. Do it in layers and don&amp;#39;t deny what comes
up, see where it takes you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Out of sight is not out of mind</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So right from the get-go you know I disagree with this mind set of &amp;quot;out of
sight, out of mind&amp;quot;. My titles are clever like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. First I&amp;#39;ll start by saying. I do see the point. I understand that if
you&amp;#39;re not seeing it then it may not even be a consideration. This is true for
stuff like... If you hire someone to take the trash out for you, suddenly you
don&amp;#39;t care about the trash that you generate, because somebody else is doing it
for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if that isn&amp;#39;t the case. Then no matter what you do it&amp;#39;s gonna be on your
mind. And here&amp;#39;s where this idea breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s great for services, like I clean the house. Eventually you&amp;#39;re gonna forget
that it was even dirty, if I come daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what happens if... if you like your dog and it disappears. Even if it is out
of sight, it is not out of mind. I mean if you&amp;#39;re a worrywart you&amp;#39;re probably
sweating bullets just thinking about what could have happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could give tons of examples, crappy ones probably, but the point is. Just
because it&amp;#39;s not on your sight, it is not gonna disappear from your mind.
That&amp;#39;s how the mind works.  You can&amp;#39;t avoid the fact that you murdered someone
just by hiding it in the dumpster or something, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point is, no matter what you do, it&amp;#39;s gonna be on your mind if you
consider it not solved or your mind considers it something that still requires
attention. You can put all of the trash of your home beneath your bed, and just
because you know it&amp;#39;s there, it&amp;#39;s gonna bother you, even if it&amp;#39;s out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Coming back to Arch Linux</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;#39;t like my love letter to Arch Linux. I actually plan to talk about
it some. lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all. I say coming back for two reasons, one I was trying out
&lt;a href=&quot;http://solydxk.com/&quot;&gt;SolydXK&lt;/a&gt; which is great! But nothing quite beats Arch for
me. Second because I wasn&amp;#39;t on vanilla Arch, I was using ArchBang because at the
time I didn&amp;#39;t have the time to figure out some stuff and there was the problem
with my modem giving us all trouble if we tried to reconnect to it before
rebooting it etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah I&amp;#39;m finally on vanilla Arch Linux. Feels so nice. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eduantech.com/2014/04/ialoadv1.html&quot;&gt;blog post
about the troubles I had when installing
it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s pretty much it. I love Arch. Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/sh-bootstrap&quot;&gt;my renovated install
scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I should mention I&amp;#39;m no longer using XMonad as my WM, I&amp;#39;m now using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i3wm.org/&quot;&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Installing Arch Linux on a Dell Vostro 1500</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is for future reference and also for other users that may run into trouble
with this, here&amp;#39;s how you can fix these issues. It&amp;#39;s likely you don&amp;#39;t even own
a Vostro 1500 though, this thing is like 7 or 8 years old (2007 AFAIK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are the issues we&amp;#39;re gonna cover and how to fix them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wifi card firmware issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop&amp;#39;s backlight does not work (at all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The wifi card&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right. So this seems to be a sort of popular problem on Linux, I even have
this problem on Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so let&amp;#39;s do the basics first. Make sure this is the problem you&amp;#39;re having.
There are plenty of guides out there on the internet on how to fix this but I am
gonna share a solution with you that works offline, which has been a lot of the
time I install a distro because Ethernet is scarce for me, if only I had a long
Ethernet cable... I have a 2 meter one, which sadly isn&amp;#39;t enough so I gotta sit
on the floor while installing. Which you know, is OK, just a little bit
uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the way to do ths is get the necessary stuff while you have the
precious internet. Find the necessary firmware somewhere on the internet OR
download the AUR package for this,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/b43-firmware/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;b43-firmware&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve done it
with only the first, I thought I would need it so I downloaded the second but in
the end I didn&amp;#39;t need it thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is just the solution I have, of course when you&amp;#39;ve installed Arch you
would mount the USB with the AUR/firmware and install it. The copy of the
firmware I have has instructions but I can&amp;#39;t seem to find where I got it from.
The AUR you&amp;#39;ll just have to know &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages&quot;&gt;how to install AUR
packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I also had to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_modules#Blacklisting&quot;&gt;blacklist&lt;/a&gt;
the &lt;code&gt;bcma&lt;/code&gt; module. Maybe, the blacklist line is there but I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure
if it&amp;#39;s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The backlight issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right. So this one completely baffled me when I came across it because
I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out what the problem was and there was some intense Googleing
happening. Not to mention I could barely see anything on the screen because it
was really dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the problem seems to be because of wrong priorities when loading the stuff
that manages backlighting. As explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;att=0;bug=651741&quot;&gt;this bug report for
Debian&lt;/a&gt;(?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I tried there had worked so here&amp;#39;s how I fixed the issue, the process or
solution may not be exactly the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;acpi_backlight=vendor&lt;/code&gt; to the bootloader&amp;#39;s kernel line, which is managed by
whatever bootloader you have, I use Syslinux so that was quite painless. And
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_modules#Blacklisting&quot;&gt;blacklist&lt;/a&gt;
the &lt;code&gt;dell-laptop&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole reason that works and stuff is explained in that bug report so read it
if you&amp;#39;re interested, or not if you&amp;#39;re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I hope that helps. This will certainly save me hours in the future,
I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Text editor categories</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So something I have noticed recently is that text editors seem to have their own
categories now. And I think this will add oil to the flame wars of the godly
text editor wars. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to speak about IDEs, since they hold no interest to me and they
cater to a more specific type of users. Some of the categories below can be
IDE-ized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just so you understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about, here&amp;#39;s a quick list of the
text editor categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful text editing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neovim.org/&quot;&gt;Nvim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yup, only two, those are the ones I know.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful customizability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lighttable.com/&quot;&gt;Light Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to use, but powerful:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://limetext.org/&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt; (WIP clone of Sublime Text)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple but useable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gedit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notepad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s go over each of these and see the differences IMO and things that seem
to stand out between these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Powerful text editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the Vim category. Here are the Vim types, clones etc. Their job is to get the
job done as quickly and as easily as possible. Want to copy the line &lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt;, BAM.
Open a new line above or below the current line &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;, BAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So their job is to get the job done. They emphasize powerful text editing.
Getting stuff done quickly. Their more of an editor than an IDE environment.
They only edit text, as best as possible, and that&amp;#39;s all. They are usually
keyboard-driven as that&amp;#39;s most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Powerful customizability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the monster that can do anything you throw at it. The Emacs category.
It could even emulate the rest of the categories if it so wished. It&amp;#39;s job is to
cater to the most intricated users as best as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want it to only save if the file is over a certain file size, feasible. Want it
to save the file, make a backup of it, compile it and make a backup of that,
again feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s up with them. They have special structures or the choice of
language to configure them is super powerful. They seem to prefer Lisp as
a language is what I&amp;#39;ve noticed. Emacs has TONS of stuff to achieve this goal.
Light Table has it&amp;#39;s own structure that could do basically anything, and it&amp;#39;s
built on top of a browser (basically) so you program in the powerful DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Light Table has it&amp;#39;s own power which will revolutionize programming,
IMO, which is live and alive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my personal favorite, along with an emulation of the Vim category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Easy to use, but powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a category I was fond of for a while. The ST (Sublime Text) category.
These are the powerful, often beautiful text editors that seem to cater to web
designers, new developers, more normal users that need some kind of oompf in
their text editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They prefer to be elegant, well looking, user friendly, and emulate to some
level the other categories, especially the Vim category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can easily be expanded upon to add new stuff to them, often getting them to
near IDE level, but still maintaining a clean look and powerful functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The users on the above categories may not be very fond of this category, as it
may be a bit weak for their liking. Atom, however, may be liked by the Emacs
category users it seems. Haven&amp;#39;t tried it myself but it seems like it&amp;#39;ll be
a more Emacs category text editors...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simple but useable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally we have the barebones text editors. The Notepad category. They are
often not too powerful, but they can get the job done, often well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t have that much to offer but you know, they work and they save you in
a pinch sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think these will be very involved in text editor wars, as they often
don&amp;#39;t care, most probably.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My experience with SolydXK (X)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;#39;ll share my experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://solydxk.com/&quot;&gt;SolydXK&lt;/a&gt;, a Debian
based semi-rolling release. I&amp;#39;ll just try to keep it short but still providing
enough info for you to have learned something from this. I think I&amp;#39;ve spent
almost 2 weeks with this distro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first taste of Debian in general, so if i point out SolydXK has
something, although it&amp;#39;s obvious because it&amp;#39;s a Debian distro, please excuse me.
You can contact me at my email (in the bottom) in order to point out the error.
;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s get started! First the installation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the &lt;a href=&quot;http://solydxk.com/homeedition/solydxk-multi-dvd/&quot;&gt;SolydXK Multi DVD&lt;/a&gt;
ISO into an 8GB USB using &lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=23267&quot;&gt;this
guide&lt;/a&gt; (which is my
favorite guide BTW, as it&amp;#39;s just a reference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation was the most pleasant installation I&amp;#39;ve had of any Linux
distro, even something like Ubuntu. Besides the fact it was clear on the
choices&amp;#39; purpose, it looked nice and other things, most importantly of all for
me is that it supported the dreaded
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;b43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wireless card drivers,
which is a huge plus for me cause I don&amp;#39;t have Ethernet readily available. I had
Ethernet while doing this though, and the fact it recognized it needed to
install it was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t have Ethernet though I have on my USB some firmware files readily
available to copy them where they need to go. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b43 users out there, this is the best experience I&amp;#39;ve had with this driver in
any distro.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinda sad that it doesn&amp;#39;t have a super &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.solydxk.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;amp;t=3464&quot;&gt;minimalistic
version&lt;/a&gt;, which my Arch
Linux in me cries about, but I&amp;#39;m willing to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;em&gt;HUGE&lt;/em&gt; con with this one though, maybe will get fixed in the future,
but it doesn&amp;#39;t figure out there&amp;#39;s other distros installed on the same HDD, and
deletes the Grub entries for those (although of course the data is untouched).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The general experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would give this a very good rating. Nothing posed any problems really, yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To switch to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://i3wm.org/&quot;&gt;i3 window manager&lt;/a&gt; I just all I had to do
was install it with &lt;code&gt;# apt-get install i3&lt;/code&gt; and choose it from the list of setups
(at the screen where you&amp;#39;re asked your password, one of top right icons). Very
enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes pre-installed with some stuff, Firefox, Thunderbird, Flash, LibreOffice
and some other stuff. Which is fine with me since I use all of those, it does
have some other stuff I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever use though, probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The update manager is very nice. It just updated today (as I&amp;#39;m writing this) and
it&amp;#39;s nicer now. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice. If you want a rolling release Debian, I&amp;#39;d go with this if I couldn&amp;#39;t
use Arch for whatever reason, granted I haven&amp;#39;t tried other Debian distros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, I did not explain core mechanics that you&amp;#39;ve probably already read about,
this is just to share my experience, not really a review or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Disconnecting from the DocPad community</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So this is something like an official announcement. The original announcement
can be found on this GitHub issue:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/821#issuecomment-38612150&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/821#issuecomment-38612150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;m super lazy so I&amp;#39;m just linking to the original. lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This no longer applies. Ben has found a way to reignite my interest in it.  And
since now I spend much more time in Node.js DocPad is a big focus point for me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Read stuff you have read before</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I dunno if you have experienced this in the past, but I know I have. It&amp;#39;s a very
curious thing indeed; Have you ever read something about technology or whatever
field you are in, a month after you did so originally, and suddenly a lot of
stuff makes a ton more sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Like for example, I read something about how RAM works or what RAM is.  I sorta
understand, I know it stands for &quot;Random Access Memory&quot; and that gives me an
idea of what it does etc.

Then I&#39;m reading about the motherboard a week later. There I learn what it does,
why a good motherboard is good, what some ports are for, why they require
a certain order to put the RAM in (if you don&#39;t fill all the slots).

Then I read about... I dunno the processor and then later the graphics card.
And so on and so forth.

I see videos on the subject, read tons of posts etc. You know just have an
interest in this stuff.

Then I decide I will read that first post about RAM. *All of a sudden*, I learn
a TON more stuff from it. Oh OK, so &quot;DDRn&quot; in RAM is actually the speed at which
it can transfer data. OK. Oh and it stands for &quot;Double Data Rate&quot;. OK, cool. Oh
OK, so the order of where you put the RAM matters because of how the motherboard
connects it to the processor and stuff.

This is just an example, actually what really happened is I heard something,
I looked it up cause I was curious and went on with my life. But then [this
video by
Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ&amp;index=5&amp;list=FLicj4_k_90isv5i45zoK4Cg)
completely cleared up for me WHY better parts are better, you know?
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my very clear reasoning for this is, you study something, OK got it, later
when you study it again it&amp;#39;s much clearer and obvious and you can think in it
much better because now you have experience/more knowledge to link it to. So
before it was a stray piece of info, now it&amp;#39;s clear how it interacts with
everything. Or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, read stuff you&amp;#39;ve read before, as long as you&amp;#39;ve learned other stuff
of the same subject or you have been working with the same subject, stuff will
make more sense and will be clearer in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Real science, not bullshit</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This one should be short.  But the point is, WTF.  It has always pissed me off
in anime, manga etc., even IRL, that the characters can&amp;#39;t believe what&amp;#39;s
actually happening right in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example.  If in front a scientist a glowing light appeared they would say
it&amp;#39;s not real and it can&amp;#39;t happen, it can&amp;#39;t be happening.  It cannot be
explained thus it has not happened and isn&amp;#39;t happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defies science itself.  Science is not about &amp;quot;can it be explained?&amp;quot;,
science is about &amp;quot;if we do this 100 times, does it always happen the same way?&amp;quot;.
That&amp;#39;s science and not bullshit.  If it&amp;#39;s happening in front of you, whether or
not you know why, whether you can explain it or not, whether you have any idea
what&amp;#39;s going on or not, it&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something works every time, and it can be constantly proven a certain way,
whether it&amp;#39;s right or not, whether it breaks some &amp;quot;laws of physics&amp;quot; or not, it&amp;#39;s
happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet if something breaks the speed of light they&amp;#39;ll say that&amp;#39;s impossible
because the speed of light is unattainable except by light.  Even if it&amp;#39;s
happening in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, the laws of physics thing, pisses me off how they are called &amp;quot;laws&amp;quot;, but
they are only a set of facts that have been proven to be true most of the time,
not going to say always.  If it suddently turns out gravity repels instead of
attracting, that&amp;#39;s not possible because laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Oxford English dictionary, &amp;quot;is a theoretical principle deduced
from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of phenomena, and
expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if
certain conditions be present.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it can be changed, but it seems they are set in stone and will never change
for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dunno.  Just pisses me off, that is all.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My explanation of The Zone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So.  A lot of programmers talk about &amp;quot;the zone&amp;quot;, this high performance mode that
programmers get into is one that the most pro of the athletes also seem to
experience.  It is described as a &amp;quot;zone&amp;quot; where the people that experience it are
just so concentrated that nothing distracts them and they can get great work
done very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scientists can&amp;#39;t explain this and the best explanation I have seen of this
(IIRC) is that it&amp;#39;s a result of &amp;quot;time slowing down&amp;quot;, where your senses just get
so sharp you can feel time slowing down, or so it is described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice I am mixing two kinds of &amp;quot;zones&amp;quot; here, the programmer&amp;#39;s zone and
the athlete&amp;#39;s zone, this is on purpose, you&amp;#39;ll see later on why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I got thinking about this originally because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/f84n5oFoZBc&quot;&gt;Rich Hickey&amp;#39;s Hammock
Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;.  I got thinking about his
idea.  There is an excellent summary by the website &lt;a href=&quot;http://data-sorcery.org/&quot;&gt;Data Sorcery With
Clojure&lt;/a&gt; which can be found here:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/&quot;&gt;http://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://incanter.org/images/misc/hammock-driven-dev.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hammock Driven Development cheatsheet&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now.  I disagree with him partially.  I do not think it works that way, but
that&amp;#39;s certainly seems to be the result.  So it works, but not for the right
reasons, you could say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Rich is right, partially.  Results, OK, reasons, nein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My theory of Hammock Driven Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how Rich explains it is that there&amp;#39;s basically two minds.  Evaluation and
Preparation.  Probably don&amp;#39;t go by these names in Rich&amp;#39;s world, but you get the
idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s where I disagree.  There&amp;#39;s only one mind in my book, it just has
different priorities, now let me explain that cause it&amp;#39;s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attention units&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now assume attention units are just some kind of unit of concentration or
something, I&amp;#39;ll explain it soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so, here&amp;#39;s my idea of how the mind actually works, in terms of the zone.
One mind, different priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m just standing still.  My mind at this point is doing all kinds
of shit.  Keeping track of bodily functions, breathing, blood pumping, all of
the organs that process food and stuff, recording perceptions and evaluating
them, keeping balance of the body.  All of this shit is happening real time,
often so quickly and so easily we don&amp;#39;t pay much attention to it, but it&amp;#39;s still
happening.  It is still doing all of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider when you are sleeping or just relaxing.  A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of these senses
are dulled or just completely shut down. When I&amp;#39;m sleeping all that&amp;#39;s happening
is breathing, blood pumping, and some bodily functions, but in general my body
is quiet. My senses are practically hibernating (in computer terms), just
awaiting the call that is &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve slept enough&amp;quot; or some kind of waking up call, of
any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider the mind&amp;#39;s availability in both of these situations. In the first
it&amp;#39;s busy, in the second it&amp;#39;s got free time.  People often consider dreams as
just your mind processing and organizing the stuff that happened during the day,
that might very well be it entertaining itself, but that&amp;#39;s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so now, what are attention units? Let&amp;#39;s say you are... thinking about cats
with your eyes closed while sitting down or laying down.  Most of your attention
units are on the cats, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re thinking about, some are on perceptics
etc. There are also some on what you&amp;#39;re going to eat next, mental memos, that
call you need to do right after thinking of cats etc.  Everything you have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
attention of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind has some of your attention units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have more of these attention units at their disposal, because of
their environment, their natural &amp;quot;talent&amp;quot; (not my favorite word to be honest)
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, according to Rich, all the problems we&amp;#39;ve solved have been solved by the
Evaluation mind at some point, and while we consider ourselves smart because we
think of solutions fast it&amp;#39;s just because at some point this problem had already
been solved by the Evaluation mind and you just need to call it back to your
Preparation mind. Rich is actually quite vague IIRC on this, but that&amp;#39;s the
general idea AFAIK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my opinion, that&amp;#39;s wrong.  It&amp;#39;s one mind, just different priorities
at different times with different problems and different amounts of attention
units.  Turns out while sleeping it has more time to spend attention units on
your problem, thus solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People that are good at maths (without being some sort of parrot) just have
attention units at their disposal... and practice.  They have these attention
units in order to have &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot; in their mind of number values that they need
to keep floating around.  Plus good mind processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not two minds, only one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind has different priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While sleeping the priorities are few, thus more time for your problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While awake, you can still solve problems from scratch, speed depends from
person to person...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this depends &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; on the person. His emotional and mental status
and aptitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just my two cents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.:&lt;/strong&gt; Forgot to talk about the zone.  Oops.  Basically, just &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your
attention units are on what matters to you, thus you have more time to think and
nothing distracts you since your attention units aren&amp;#39;t on that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The world of Window Managers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that I&amp;#39;m writing this at 23:00 in Switzerland&amp;#39;s time,
so please forgive any stupidities. Usually I go to sleep at 22:00 or something
like that.  Really need to go to sleep for tomorrow...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.  I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about WMs (Window Managers) in GNU/Linux, those
that can be found in Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: I went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmonad.org/&quot;&gt;XMonad&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;#39;s my config files:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the TL;SR (Too Long; Still Read) version will start by me saying that I tried
almost, if not all of the WMs.  I can confidently say I&amp;#39;m dissapoined there
isn&amp;#39;t a single stacking WM that is keyboard controlled, besides the mouse.
That would be my ideal setup.  But there isn&amp;#39;t, so I tried a lot of dynamic WMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short list of those I tried is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm&quot;&gt;BSPWM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmonad.org/&quot;&gt;XMonad&lt;/a&gt;, I went with this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146889&quot;&gt;Alopex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://awesome.naquadah.org/&quot;&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the most notable ones.  The ones that I honestly tried for a while and
can give a fair review or opinion for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alopex&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with Alopex.  Alopex is the one I like the most after XMonad.  I&amp;#39;ve
used it for at least... 2 or 3 months or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very nice, almost ideal, but it lacks the configurability I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one I really liked.  I used this one for... 1 or 2 weeks, give or take a
few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked it but it&amp;#39;s too heavy for me. Also I don&amp;#39;t like Lua and the config seems
to change every single update, which isn&amp;#39;t good IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BSPWM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one I was most excited for TBH, but I couldn&amp;#39;t get Dzen2 to work
correctly with it so I had to give up. Super powerful window management though,
I suggest you try this one before XMonad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;XMonad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally XMonad.  The king of tiling WMs it seems.  Atleast for me.  What makes
XMonad unique for me is that it&amp;#39;s written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;,
the language I have my eye on, and that I&amp;#39;m currently trying to learn, to a
degree, to see if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A config tutorial, tour whatever will come later in another blog post, in the
meanwhile just know I went with XMonad, and you can find my config files here: https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s something you think could be said better in this post or you find a
typo feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/the-world-of-window-managers.html.md&quot;&gt;modify it&lt;/a&gt;
and make a pull request for it!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My trip to Switzerland, part 1, getting there</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to make it clear that this will probably be writen over several
sessions over several days.  I&amp;#39;ve mentioned several times that I won&amp;#39;t have good
internet during the time I&amp;#39;m over here, so I&amp;#39;m sticking to that.  Sorry if some
info is inconsistent, I&amp;#39;ll do my best to keep it consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the time and date formats will be kept as near to the Switzerland method
for written time as possible, since I like it.  I.E. time is in 24 hour format
and dates use &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; in between and it&amp;#39;s a &lt;code&gt;DD.MM.YYYY&lt;/code&gt; format, not the crazy
&lt;code&gt;MM/DD/YYYY&lt;/code&gt; format USA uses.  Swear to god all they need to do is make a USD
worth 99 cents and they will have officially messed up their entire numerical
system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ll be skipping all the drama and just get to the point.  I won&amp;#39;t add
unnecessary info that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter, though people would usually tell
you all about it.  lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was written the 15.01.2014 at 11:40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we got to the airport and we just checked-in, no troubles, we ate some and
then we just waited to board the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to point out at this point there was like a 50 person line to get on
the plane.  We were able to skip that thanks to my magic of my seat being moved
and letting me and my family just skip the whole line.  Yay for magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flew with Lufthansa airlines. It was a really nice service, the staff was
very nice and knew very good English.  Also everybody was good looking (but
that&amp;#39;s to be expected from an airline, AFAIK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived ahead of schedule, I&amp;#39;m told, but we left behind schedule, I&amp;#39;m told.
So I guess I&amp;#39;m just really good at planes.  lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we took another air plane but this one was just a 45 minute flight or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step was to take a bus to the train station and ride the train to the
Grenchen Nord station.  So we missed our stop, not really but we didn&amp;#39;t know
that the doors had to be opened manually (by pressing a button) so we missed the
stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted our friends over here and they told us to just take the train to
the Grenchen Süd station, which was actually nearer to our destination (but
required a train switch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we rode the train to Grenchen Süd, this time we knew how to open the door,
got off and familiar faces were there so all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a car ride to the place we&amp;#39;re staying at, unpacked a bit, took a shower and
went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re back to the present time of me writing this. I actually just woke up
and I have no internet, everybody else just started waking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so now to the all important lessons (that I can remember) learned of every
trip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For god&amp;#39;s sake keep calm! It is not nice to be nervous or to be around someone
that&amp;#39;s nervous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travelling on air planes isn&amp;#39;t as special as it used to be.  Now there&amp;#39;s
screens on the seats and all kinds of stuff to cheat with getting
entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buses and trains require you to open the door, they will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; open alone at
every stop.  Know where you&amp;#39;re going and at which stop it is you&amp;#39;re getting
off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If on a new area, keep track of what people are doing, it will help you figure
out what to do yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those are all I can think of. This was written in one go so it should be
fairly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find any typo (especially with names) please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-15-mttsp1.md&quot;&gt;make a pull
request&lt;/a&gt;
fixing it and I will happily merge. :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A love letter to Arch Linux</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a love letter to Arch Linux. It&amp;#39;s the first time I write something like
this, it was very fun. If you see anything in between square brackets (&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;)
it&amp;#39;s an author&amp;#39;s note. Note that some stuff is exaggerated for the drama but my
feelings are still true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arch, I remember it clear as day how I abandoned you in July for a Mac Mini.
I remember typing the last &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl poweroff&lt;/code&gt; you would see for over
3 months. I remember the slowness with which you turned off that last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the speed and enthusiasm with which you booted up after months of
hanging around the modem in storage, only to see your sadness when I turned you
off quickly as I was going to install Windows 7 over you. [Was going to lend
computer.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember downloading your torrent again a week ago, I remember the speed with
which you downloaded and with which you &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;d to an 8GB USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is completely understandeable that you had a tantrum when I came back to you,
it is completely understandeable that you gave me a hard time with the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the modem, it is completely understandeable that you have trouble
with him, it is completely understandeable that the modem rejects a second
connection without being reset after you left him as soon as I tried to install
you again. [This is a reference to the fact my damn modem has to be restarted
every time this computer wants to connect to it.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YET! After convincing your sister to help me (ArchBang) you were willing to work
again for me. And now every time I boot up you&amp;#39;re there to welcome me home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always love you, Arch. I promise I won&amp;#39;t be promiscuous again. I promise
I won&amp;#39;t leave you again for another OS. I promise I will look after you, even
when I get new computers. You&amp;#39;re the only one for me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Switching from Zsh to fish</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that I already switched back to zsh. lol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;#39;ll be talking about my experience with switching from zsh (&lt;strong&gt;Z&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;sh&lt;/strong&gt;ell) to fish (&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;riendly &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nteractive &lt;strong&gt;sh&lt;/strong&gt;ell). I&amp;#39;m not gonna talk
about how or why it&amp;#39;s better than the other shells, I&amp;#39;m only gonna talk about
the process of switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start... well, how about starting with the fact that I tried to do the
switch before? I did try to do the switch before, I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what
problems I had last time but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it was something with Vim or
something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try the switch again taking advantage of the fact that a new
version had been released recently
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://fishshell.com/release_notes.html&quot;&gt;v2.1.0&lt;/a&gt;). Seemed like a good idea to
try again, also the fact that I like the features it has, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switch wasn&amp;#39;t as problem-free as I wished but it was quite a smooth process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I was running across problems with Vim which I imagine I wasn&amp;#39;t able to
solve last time, but I solved this time. The problem was a startup error that
Vim was complaining about not finding a certain file or something. I just had to
add the following to the top of my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file to fix it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;if $SHELL =~ &amp;#39;fish&amp;#39;
    set shell=/bin/sh
endif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if Vim can detect the &lt;code&gt;$SHELL&lt;/code&gt; variable is &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; it&amp;#39;ll tell Vim to
interact with the current shell as if it was &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt;. As I understand it, don&amp;#39;t
take my word for it, please. That fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem I was running into was that Emacs was complaining about not
being able to find the &lt;code&gt;package.el&lt;/code&gt; file. The reason for the error was that
I was opening an old version of Emacs (v22.x). This was just a matter of
updating the &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable, that was done with the following line of code in
my &lt;code&gt;config.fish&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;set PATH /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/npm/bin /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin $HOME/bin $HOME/.tmuxifier/tmuxifier/bin $PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm... Those were the only real note-worthy parts. The rest were just a matter
of translating zsh to fish. You can find the latest version of my config files
here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/config/fish&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/config/fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s something you think could be said better or is plain wrong in this
post feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/switching-from-zsh-to-fish.html.md&quot;&gt;modify

				<title>Light Table, the new Emacs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The title may be misleading so I&amp;#39;m gonna make it clear right now. I couldn&amp;#39;t
come up with anything better. It&amp;#39;s gonna stay like that, so you can make
suggestions for a better title but I won&amp;#39;t change the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me explain why I chose this title. That&amp;#39;s what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a popular saying that Vim users love to use against Emacs users in the
holy editor wars. That saying is &amp;quot;Emacs would make a great OS, if only it had
a good text editor.&amp;quot; or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can sort of agree with that. Emacs&amp;#39; editor is not superior to Vim&amp;#39;s in
almost any front. But let&amp;#39;s look at the bright side of that saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re criticizing the text editor. But they&amp;#39;re acknowledging it as an OS. In
other words it apparently can be extended immensely. And it has proven to be
able to do just that. It has just about anything that can be done in text. Email
reader, news reader, chat, calendar, you name it. And if it isn&amp;#39;t already
implemented, you can do it yourself! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, it can be extended immensely towards developing. Debuggers, the
CLI, automatic compiling functionality, people have made it an IDE as well. So
its limits are practically none. Oh and let&amp;#39;s not forget about the language you
use to customize it. Emacs Lisp, A.K.A. Elisp; Its own dialect of Lisp. You
can&amp;#39;t get a lot more customizable than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except you can... Enter Light Table!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lighttable.com/&quot;&gt;Light Table&lt;/a&gt; is one of the new kids on the block.
It is coded in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure.org/clojurescript&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;, a Lisp dialect
that essentially compiles to JS. The other new kid is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/limetext/lime&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;, but he still hasn&amp;#39;t got a working
frontend (at the time of writing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-granger.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Granger&lt;/a&gt; (the main dev of Light Table) has
created a unique architecture with Light Table. (As I understand it) you can add
or remove anything and everything. Well maybe not everything since you&amp;#39;ll always
want some stuff there but you know what I mean. Think about the ECS (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system&quot;&gt;Entity
Component System&lt;/a&gt;), that&amp;#39;s
almost &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what Light Table has as an architecture. It is the first text
editor of its kind in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has created a very interesting system with Light Table where the basic text
editor is loaded by default. All of the text editor you get by default are just
behaviours. These behaviours can be added, removed, disabled, enabled. I&amp;#39;m sure
you get where I&amp;#39;m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be anything and everything with due time! It could be the first real
competitor for Emacs as well in terms of customizability. Think about it, it&amp;#39;s
written in ClojureScript, a Lisp dialect, you can add or remove behaviours, to
the point where you can make it a NotePad or a browser if you liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that it is using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit&quot;&gt;node-webkit&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;#39;s platform. It
allows you to call Node.js from the DOM. That&amp;#39;s right, Light Table the text
editor with almost no limits is technically a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means JS is its limit. If you can&amp;#39;t do it with JS (and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;) you can&amp;#39;t do it in Light Table. But if you can do
it in JS you can do it in Light Table. JS is quickly becoming the one language
to write. JS is found almost everywhere nowadays. So I think Chris has made
a smart decision when he decided to write it in ClojureScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point is, it&amp;#39;s got (almost) no limit on what can be added &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; no
limit on what can be removed, something Emacs is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and one more thing. Emacs is millions of lines of Elisp plus the C code it
uses. Light Table is only around twelve thousand lines of ClojureScript, at the
time of writing (v0.5.18).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah. My point is, it&amp;#39;ll possibly be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; text editor once a couple of years
pass after it&amp;#39;s full release and it is more mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s something you think could be said better in this post feel free to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/light-table-the-new-emacs.html.md&quot;&gt;modify
it&lt;/a&gt;
and make a pull request for it!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Open source games without going poor</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Release your game for a fee, after a certain amount of time release
source code, continue selling pre-compiled version to public. Open source
games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the idea? What do I mean with open source games?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love open source. I try to make everything I use open source whenever
possible. There are lot of great projects I use and sometimes contribute to that
are open source. For example Clojure, Vim, Chromium (all of which I use) or
DocPad (to which I contribute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love games, I mean who doesn&amp;#39;t? Doesn&amp;#39;t have to be video games for it to
be a game, there&amp;#39;s also physical games like Tag, Hide-and-Seek etc. They are all
free, open source, they&amp;#39;re just an idea, you see kids modifying games in order
to make them more interesting all the time! Most video games aren&amp;#39;t open source
however. You pay for a game, you play it, finish it (or complete it), move on to
the next game. The games that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; open source are so simple there isn&amp;#39;t any
gain in making them not open source, if anything you lose from making them
closed source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of, if not all developers love open source. However, a lot of us
developers make games for a living. We can&amp;#39;t make them open source, we would
have to live off of donations, which are inconsistent if there are donations and
if there aren&amp;#39;t well... we&amp;#39;re in deep shit if we don&amp;#39;t have a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is an idea I had that tries to solve that. Us open source lovers who
want to make a decent living off of making &lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt; games will be able to
do this with this idea I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, release the game to the public for a fee as usual, however
after an agreed amount of time, which you decide, release the game&amp;#39;s source.
Make it open source. However, continue selling the pre-compiled game to the
public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s really a simple idea. You release the game for a fee for a certain
amount of time in order to make a living or at least make up for what you lost
in the development process. After that certain amount of time is up you release
the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the game open source however you are still making an income from
non-techie users or just nice users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would this work? Smart users would just wait a year or whatever and
compile the source and done, they won&amp;#39;t pay anything, why would they? They&amp;#39;re
&lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; about it. This idea is just a recipe for disaster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the way I see it, if your game is good enough, people won&amp;#39;t care about
paying for it. They won&amp;#39;t mind keeping you alive by giving you $5 or whatever
your game costs. In fact they would be glad that you made that game. AND, as an
added bonus, if they&amp;#39;re interested in the game&amp;#39;s source code to see how you
figured out this holy-crap-that-looks-crazy thing in your game, they can do
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most probably if the don&amp;#39;t pay for your game it&amp;#39;s because they want some sort of
trial period or they can&amp;#39;t even afford the game anyway. So really you&amp;#39;re not
losing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;#39;ll be the users that just compile the game, play it, finish and
complete it and uninstall it, never touching it again. How many users are like
that? In my experience with people, not many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a trust issue. Do you trust your users enough to be nice enough to
let you live? Or not? I trust them, they&amp;#39;re playing my awesome game, why
wouldn&amp;#39;t they want to keep me alive for me to make more games?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at it the other way, maybe people are interested in your game not
for the game itself, but the code. They approach your game&amp;#39;s code because you
figured something out that they&amp;#39;ve had a hard time figuring out. They figure out
stuff for you that you did wrong and make pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have an income one way or another. Be it through code or money. If they
help with the code they help with the overall game so the sales would be better,
for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a crazy but not impossible idea I had while thinking on my bed, so
it&amp;#39;s not really fleshed out, since there isn&amp;#39;t anything to flesh out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also it&amp;#39;s kinda hastily written, so if there&amp;#39;s something you think could be said
better in this post feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/open-source-games-without-going-poor.html.md&quot;&gt;modify
it&lt;/a&gt;
and make a pull request for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://raamdev.com/income-ethics-series/&quot;&gt;Income Ethics - Raam Dev&lt;/a&gt; - A very
deep look into a similar subject, he mentions something extremly similar to
this idea in &lt;a href=&quot;http://raamdev.com/income-ethics-series/#public_domain&quot;&gt;this
section&lt;/a&gt; of his post.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>The switch to DocPad</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org&quot;&gt;DocPad&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;
based static website generator. It&amp;#39;s a static website generator but if you wish
it can be completely dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeekup.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeKup&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/eco&quot;&gt;Eco&lt;/a&gt; as templating languages and normal
JavaScript for the &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; files. And I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt; for
the CSS, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that&amp;#39;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)&lt;/p&gt;
