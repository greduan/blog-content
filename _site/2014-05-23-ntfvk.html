      <h1>Neat trick for Vim keybindings</h1>
      <p>2014-05-22</p>

    <p>I actually found this out while looking at another person's vimrc while looking
for some good Unite config, cause I'm not really comfortable with advanced VimL,
which Unite for sure uses.</p>
<p>The specific lines are these:
<a href="https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580">https://github.com/bling/dotvim/blob/0c9b4e7183/vimrc#L565-L580</a></p>
<p>This gave me an awesome hint, which is that you can actually set a key blank so
that by itself it does nothing but with an extra key it does something.  In this
case it's the space key.  And also that you could alias a key to another value.</p>
<p>So now I use it like this in my vimrc (changes I haven't pushed yet though, at
the time of writing):</p>
<pre><code class="language-vim">nm &lt;space&gt; [space]
nn [space] &lt;NOP&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And a lot of my filesystem and buffer plugins use these keybinds.  I may even
set it up eventually so that it completely replaces my leader key, which I
honestly don't use much anyway, nowadays.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Posted a question on StackOverflow and it seems it's nothing too special.  Still
a neat trick though: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940">http://stackoverflow.com/q/23839528/1622940</a></p>
