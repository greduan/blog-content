				<p>In short, it was way way way way simpler than I expected it to be.  It took less
than 10 mins to update OpenBSD from 5.6 to 5.7.  And then another half an hour
to update all my packages with <code># pkg_add -u</code>.</p>
<p>The reason I was scared is because I am unfamiliar with this sort of upgrade
procedure, I am used to rolling distros where to update you just run one command
every once in a while and you're up-to-date.  I never used Debian or Ubuntu
extensively so I didn't get to experience freeze periods, OS version numbers
etc.</p>
<p>I mean there's not much more to say about that.  Just so that it's not a really
short post I'll lay out the steps I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded the <code>install57.fs</code></li>
<li><code>dd if=install57.fs of=/dev/sd0c bs=4M</code> (<code>of=</code> may vary for you)</li>
<li>Booted into USB</li>
<li>Chose <code>(U)pgrade</code> instead of <code>(I)nstall</code> or <code>(A)uto Install</code></li>
<li>Went through procedure</li>
<li>Rebooted</li>
<li>Read mail (just reports)</li>
<li><code># sysmerge</code></li>
<li><code># pkg_add -u</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And that was it.  It was way simpler than I expected.</p>
<p>I will be upgrading to -current soon enough so I can write about the experience,
also I need the latest <code>sort</code> to have the <code>nvm</code> bug fixed.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Today is May 2nd.  I just realised there is an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade57.html">upgrade guide for 5.6 to 5.7</a>.  I just read that today and I ran the steps,
I missed this part of the upgrade earlier.  Oops.</p>
