	<p><em>Note that I already switched back to zsh. lol</em></p>

<p>In this post I&#39;ll be talking about my experience with switching from zsh (<strong>Z</strong>
<strong>sh</strong>ell) to fish (<strong>F</strong>riendly <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>sh</strong>ell). I&#39;m not gonna talk
about how or why it&#39;s better than the other shells, I&#39;m only gonna talk about
the process of switching.</p>

<p>Where to start... well, how about starting with the fact that I tried to do the
switch before? I did try to do the switch before, I don&#39;t remember exactly what
problems I had last time but I&#39;m pretty sure it was something with Vim or
something.</p>

<p>I decided to try the switch again taking advantage of the fact that a new
version had been released recently
(<a href="http://fishshell.com/release_notes.html">v2.1.0</a>). Seemed like a good idea to
try again, also the fact that I like the features it has, of course.</p>

<p>The switch wasn&#39;t as problem-free as I wished but it was quite a smooth process.</p>

<p>First, I was running across problems with Vim which I imagine I wasn&#39;t able to
solve last time, but I solved this time. The problem was a startup error that
Vim was complaining about not finding a certain file or something. I just had to
add the following to the top of my <code>.vimrc</code> file to fix it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">if $SHELL =~ &#39;fish&#39;
    set shell=/bin/sh
endif
</code></pre></div>
<p>Basically, if Vim can detect the <code>$SHELL</code> variable is <code>fish</code> it&#39;ll tell Vim to
interact with the current shell as if it was <code>sh</code>. As I understand it, don&#39;t
take my word for it, please. That fixed that.</p>

<p>Another problem I was running into was that Emacs was complaining about not
being able to find the <code>package.el</code> file. The reason for the error was that
I was opening an old version of Emacs (v22.x). This was just a matter of
updating the <code>$PATH</code> variable, that was done with the following line of code in
my <code>config.fish</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">set PATH /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/npm/bin /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin $HOME/bin $HOME/.tmuxifier/tmuxifier/bin $PATH
</code></pre></div>
<p>Umm... Those were the only real note-worthy parts. The rest were just a matter
of translating zsh to fish. You can find the latest version of my config files

<p>If there&#39;s something you think could be said better or is plain wrong in this
post feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/switching-from-zsh-to-fish.html.md">modify
it</a>
and make a pull request for it!</p>
