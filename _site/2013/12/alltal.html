		<h1>A love letter to Arch Linux</h1>
		<p class="meta">13 Dec 2013</p>
	</header>

	<p>This is a love letter to Arch Linux. It&#39;s the first time I write something like
this, it was very fun. If you see anything in between square brackets (<code>[]</code>)
it&#39;s an author&#39;s note. Note that some stuff is exaggerated for the drama but my
feelings are still true.</p>

<hr>

<p>Arch, I remember it clear as day how I abandoned you in July for a Mac Mini.
I remember typing the last <code>sudo systemctl poweroff</code> you would see for over
3 months. I remember the slowness with which you turned off that last time.</p>

<p>I remember the speed and enthusiasm with which you booted up after months of
hanging around the modem in storage, only to see your sadness when I turned you
off quickly as I was going to install Windows 7 over you. [Was going to lend
computer.]</p>

<p>I remember downloading your torrent again a week ago, I remember the speed with
which you downloaded and with which you <code>dd</code>&#39;d to an 8GB USB.</p>

<p>It is completely understandeable that you had a tantrum when I came back to you,
it is completely understandeable that you gave me a hard time with the internet.</p>

<p>And of course, the modem, it is completely understandeable that you have trouble
with him, it is completely understandeable that the modem rejects a second
connection without being reset after you left him as soon as I tried to install
you again. [This is a reference to the fact my damn modem has to be restarted
every time this computer wants to connect to it.]</p>

<p>YET! After convincing your sister to help me (ArchBang) you were willing to work
again for me. And now every time I boot up you&#39;re there to welcome me home.</p>

<p>I will always love you, Arch. I promise I won&#39;t be promiscuous again. I promise
I won&#39;t leave you again for another OS. I promise I will look after you, even
when I get new computers. You&#39;re the only one for me.</p>
