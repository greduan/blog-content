    <p>Just thought I would share something that has been very useful to me recently,
and that is some Arch Linux font stuff.</p>
<p>First let's talk about the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle%2Bfonts">Infinality-bundle+fonts</a>.  This is SO useful!
It's basically some pre-configured font settings and fonts that make your Arch
Linux font rendering so nice.  If you want a real quick plug-and-play font
config you can use this.</p>
<p>It was nice and all but I didn't like how many downloads I had to make in each
<code>pacman -Syu</code>, granted I don't think they were too many but my internet is not
so fast that I don't care about the size of my downloads.</p>
<p>To uninstall it I had to, IIRC remove the 'infinality-bundle' repository from my
<code>pacman.conf</code> file, then I had to manually uninstall all the fonts and stuff
from this bundle.  There's probably an easy way to do this but I am not aware of
it.</p>
<p>OK so that's one solution.  There is another one which I really like since it
works quite well which can be found in this blog post: <a href="http://jaysonrowe.blogspot.mx/2013/04/font-configuration-in-arch-linux.html">From the mind of a nerd:
Font Configuration in Arch Linux</a></p>
<p>I followed his steps and it works quite well.  Some websites for some reason
don't have font smoothing but they are not many.  I did not follow the settings
he has on XFCE, because I don't have XFCE installed but if I did that it would
probably work flawlessly.</p>
<p>This solution allows me to not install anything extra and still have nice fonts
so I like it.</p>
<p>Hope these tips help you out someday. :)</p>
