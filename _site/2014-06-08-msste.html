      <h1>My slow switch to Emacs</h1>
      <p>2014-06-07</p>
    </header>

    <p>I'm going to come out and say that I like Emacs.  As a platform, not as an
editor mind you.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil</a> as is probably to be expected.  I have become so
accustomed to Vim that without some sort of Vim emulation I cannot survive in
another editor.</p>
<p>This is why I'm using Evil and I am slowly, but surely, using Emacs more and
more, making little modifications that make it nicer and and more comfortable
for me.  I'll soon probably have to write a couple of plugins in order to
achieve some Vim behaviour I like though, that'll be fun.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to share that. If I ever need to use Vim in a remote server or
for pair programming, I'm open and if I need to use Emacs I'm also open, unless
it's Emacs without Evil, in which case I am closed.</p>
<p>I have NO clue how Emacs users could use <code>C-f</code> for moving right by one, <code>C-b</code>
for back one, <code>C-n</code> to move down one and <code>C-p</code> to go up one.  It's crazy, their
hands move ALL OVER the keyboard, and they say it's fine.  Whoever says that is
either bored or crazy or both.  Or something.</p>
