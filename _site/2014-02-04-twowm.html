      <h1>The world of Window Managers</h1>
      <p>2014-02-03</p>
    </header>

    <p><strong>Note from 2015: Nowadays I don't use any of these except bspwm and/or 2bwm
sometimes, nowadays I use swm+wmutils or something really simple like that.</strong></p>
<p>Let me start off by saying that I'm writing this at 23:00 in Switzerland's time,
so please forgive any stupidities.  Usually I go to sleep at 22:00 or something
like that.  Really need to go to sleep for tomorrow...</p>
<p>Anyway.  I'm going to be talking about WMs (Window Managers) in GNU/Linux, those
that can be found in Arch Linux.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I went with <a href="http://xmonad.org">XMonad</a> for reasons.</p>
<p>So the TL;SR (Too Long; Still Read) version will start by me saying that I tried
almost, if not all of the WMs.  I can confidently say I'm dissapoined there
isn't a single stacking WM that is keyboard controlled, besides the mouse.
That would be my ideal setup.  But there isn't, so I tried a lot of dynamic WMs.</p>
<p>A short list of those I tried is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>, I went with this one</li>
<li><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146889">Alopex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the most notable ones.  The ones that I honestly tried for a while and
can give a fair review or opinion for.</p>
<h2>Alopex</h2>
<p>Let's start with Alopex.  Alopex is the one I like the most after XMonad.  I've
used it for at least... 2 or 3 months or something.</p>
<p>It is very nice, almost ideal, but it lacks the configurability I like.</p>
<h2>awesome</h2>
<p>Another one I really liked.  I used this one for... 1 or 2 weeks, give or take a
few.</p>
<p>I liked it but it's too heavy for me.  Also I don't like Lua and the config
seems to change every single update, which isn't good IMO.</p>
<h2>BSPWM</h2>
<p>This is the one I was most excited for TBH, but I couldn't get Dzen2 to work
correctly with it so I had to give up.  Super powerful window management though,
I suggest you try this one before XMonad.</p>
<h2>XMonad</h2>
<p>Finally XMonad.  The king of tiling WMs it seems.  Atleast for me.  What makes
XMonad unique for me is that it's written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, the language I have
my eye on, and that I'm currently trying to learn, to a degree, to see if I like
it.</p>
<p>This is the one I went with because of reasons.</p>
