      <h1>Switching from Zsh to fish</h1>
      <p>2013-11-12</p>
    </header>

    <p><strong>Notice from 2015: Nowadays I don't use bash, fish or zsh, nowadays I use good
old (m)ksh because it's POSIX compliant and really fast.</strong></p>
<p>In this post I'll be talking about my experience with switching from zsh (<strong>Z</strong>
<strong>sh</strong>ell) to fish (<strong>F</strong>riendly <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>sh</strong>ell).  I'm not gonna talk
about how or why it's better than the other shells, I'm only gonna talk about
the process of switching for me.</p>
<p>Where to start... well, how about starting with the fact that I tried to do the
switch before?  I did try to do the switch before, I don't remember exactly what
problems I had last time but I'm pretty sure it was something with Vim or
something.</p>
<p>I decided to try the switch again taking advantage of the fact that a new
version had been released recently (<a href="http://fishshell.com/release_notes.html">v2.1.0</a>).  Seemed like a good idea to
try again, also the fact that I like the features it has, of course.</p>
<p>The switch wasn't as problem-free as I wished but it was quite a smooth process.</p>
<p>First, I was running across problems with Vim which I imagine I wasn't able to
solve last time, but I solved this time.  The problem was a startup error that
Vim was complaining about not finding a certain file or something.  I just had
to add the following to the top of my <code>.vimrc</code> file to fix it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-vim">if $SHELL =~ 'fish'
    set shell=/bin/sh
endif
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, if Vim can detect the <code>$SHELL</code> variable is <code>fish</code> it'll tell Vim to
interact with the current shell as if it was <code>sh</code>.  As I understand it, don't
take my word for it.  That fixed that.</p>
<p>Another problem I was running into was that Emacs was complaining about not
being able to find the <code>package.el</code> file.  The reason for the error was that
I was opening an old version of Emacs (v22.x).  This was just a matter of
updating the <code>$PATH</code> variable, that was done with the following line of code in
my <code>config.fish</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">set PATH /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/npm/bin /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin $HOME/bin $HOME/.tmuxifier/tmuxifier/bin $PATH
</code></pre>
<p>Umm... Those were the only real note-worthy parts.  The rest were just a matter
of translating zsh to fish.</p>
