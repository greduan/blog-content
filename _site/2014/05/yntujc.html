	<p>Here I will share something I realized I learnt only after learning it. That is
the fact that if you want to program fluently in JS you need to understand and
know by heart JavaScript&#39;s callbacks.</p>

<p>I do want to point out that I did know callbacks were important, but I didn&#39;t
realize just how powerless you are when programming in JS and you don&#39;t know
your callbacks.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the lesson I&#39;ve learned. Now I&#39;m going to teach to you what callbacks
are.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the definition of callback, in terms of JS. A &quot;callback&quot; is, in
the simplest of the English language, what to do after the function has been
executed. That is the callback.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s look at the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">function x(a, callback) {
    var b = a + 5;
    return callback(a);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>What that code does is add <code>a</code> and <code>5</code> and give them to the callback. So this
function would be used the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">x(5, function(bap){
    console.log(bap); // returns 10
});
</code></pre></div>
<p>Do you see the connection that is happening? Before I go on I just want to make
a couple of points. The callback should be an anonymous function, I&#39;m not sure
if this is required or not but after reading a lot of code this is the only way
that I&#39;ve seen it, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the only way possible. Please correct me
if I&#39;m wrong. Secondly, the name of the argument that you use in the anonymous
function can be named anything, also the variable that you give to callback can
be named anything.</p>

<p>OK so to explain what is happening here, it&#39;s basically running function <code>x()</code>
which is assigning the value of <code>5 + 5</code> to a var <code>b</code> and that var <code>b</code> is being
passed to the callback. The callback receives the value of <code>b</code> and names it
<code>bap</code> (in this example) and then logs to the console the value of <code>bap</code>.</p>

<p>They&#39;re as simple as that, but I never saw an explanation like this. I did
understand that callbacks were what was done after the function was executed and
the results were available, but I never understood the process that it took in
order to give the anonymous function the value and what values were used by the
anonymous function.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you understand callbacks, even if just a little. Please
correct me if I said anything and please add any detail that you can. You can do
so by forking my blog and editing this blog post over at:
