	<p>I&#39;ll just say it right now, I hate timezones.  And daylight saving time, it can
go to hell.</p>

<p>I like the fact that anywhere I am in the world (not near the poles) I know 8:00
the sun is up and 20:00 the sun is down.  That&#39;s all fine and dandy. But I don&#39;t
like and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever like calculating timezones.  <em>Especially</em> with
places there&#39;s daylight saving time, where I gotta take into account if it&#39;s on
or out daylight saving time, plus my own, and they start and end at different
times, it sucks.</p>

<p>I have meetings every Monday at 21:00 (9:00 PM) UTC.  At this time we all spend
some time chatting. For me that means 3 different hours at which the meeting can
happen, because of timezones and daylight saving time. It can happen from 15:00
to 17:00.  And it was a PITA to ask when it&#39;s starting, until I started using
UTC as the reference for the time at which it&#39;s going to happen.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at what time is for a moment. We could keep track of it or not care
at all, in fact if we didn&#39;t care at all maybe some stuff would be better,
maybe.  We&#39;d use the sun and the moon to track the time, instead of saying &quot;Meet
you at 12:00 PM on the hall&quot; we&#39;d say &quot;Meet you in the hall when the sun is at
it&#39;s hottest&quot;.  That&#39;s something we can easily feel, although we&#39;d be off by
around one hour, it wouldn&#39;t really matter because our civilization would be
VERY different, where preciseness wouldn&#39;t matter that much, and when it does
maybe we just stick together or set more secure times, like when the sun starts
setting or something.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we didn&#39;t have time we wouldn&#39;t be able to coordinate time
globally, only locally where everyone knows naturally in how much time the sun
will go down.</p>

<p>So time, IMO, has it&#39;s most use when used globally. But the way we use it today
it complicates stuff way too much!  Assuming there are no timezones, it&#39;s not
that hard but still a hassle.  With our current timezones system before I do
anything with planning times I need to understand at what times in my timezone
it&#39;s day during the other timezones and find somewhere where they overlap.</p>

<p>If we used UTC it would be very simple, one side says &quot;I&#39;m available from 12:00
to 20:00&quot; and the other side knows exactly what time that is and it can say &quot;OK
let&#39;s talk at 16:00&quot;.</p>

<p>Another thing with timezones, we work at different days if on opposite sides of
the planet. Right now it&#39;s the 21st for me, but for Sydney, Australia it&#39;s the
22nd. Look at this <a href="https://github.com/bevry/website/compare/8b1506f9d7...9271a70a96">commit
diff</a>. These
commits happened in practically the same 10 minutes, but because of timezones
Git detected one of these commits being one day later.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just all agree <em>at the same time</em> to start using UTC, drop the notion that
before PM it&#39;s morning and after PM it&#39;s afternoon, drop the notion that at 8AM
the sun rises and 8PM the sun drops and just learn the UTC time for these events
in our own area.</p>

<p>That is all I have to say and this opinion won&#39;t change.  Different languages
OK, it&#39;s different cultures, but different times?  Come on.  We&#39;re all humans in
one damn planet, I&#39;m sure we can come to agree on the time.</p>
