	<p>I noticed that some years ago I used to seriously look forward to every update
that any software I was using got.  Like I&#39;d read all the changelogs and I&#39;d be
constantly checking to make sure there wasn&#39;t an update to some piece of
software that didn&#39;t update itself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s also a reason I got into Arch in the first place I think, besides the
minimalism and how I like to build my environment from the ground up.  The
reason being that it has a rolling release model, so all of my software is as
up-to-date as it can be.  Almost, I mean it doesn&#39;t go into betas, just into
every &quot;stable&quot; release according to the piece of software.</p>

<p>I think using Linux, specifically Arch Linux, for several years now has
desensitised me to software updates.  Where now I I don&#39;t look at <em>every</em>
update, instead I look at major updates, updates to the browser, to my text
editors, etc.  Stuff of which you have to be aware because a lot has changed
since you last used it, those kind of changes.</p>

<p>Just thought I would document that I guess, there&#39;s not more to this blog post.</p>
