	<p>I&#39;m going to come out and say that I like Emacs.  As a platform, not as an
editor mind you.</p>

<p>I am using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil</a> as is probably to be expected.  I have become so
accustomed to Vim that without some sort of Vim emulation I cannot survive in
another editor.</p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m using Evil and I am slowly, but surely, using Emacs more and
more, making little modifications that make it nicer and and more comfortable
for me.  I&#39;ll soon probably have to write a couple of plugins in order to
achieve some Vim behaviour I like though, that&#39;ll be fun.</p>

<p>Of course <a href="https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d">my dotfiles</a> have all my configs, can&#39;t promise they&#39;ll be
as up-to-date as they sometimes have been, because there are lots of changes
going on and that would be a very big amount of insignificant commits if
I committed everything.</p>

<p>So I just wanted to share that. If I ever need to use Vim in a remote server or
for pair programming, I&#39;m open and if I need to use Emacs I&#39;m also open, unless
it&#39;s Emacs without Evil, in which case I am closed.</p>

<p>I have NO clue how Emacs users could use <code>C-f</code> for moving right by one, <code>C-b</code>
for back one, <code>C-n</code> to move down one and <code>C-p</code> to go up one.  It&#39;s crazy, their
hands move ALL OVER the keyboard, and they say it&#39;s fine.  Whoever says that is
either bored or crazy or both.  Or something.</p>

<p>That is all.  Feel free to share anything you want on my dotfiles by forking
them or what have you. :)</p>
