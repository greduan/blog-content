	<p>Ever have that moment when you realize something that you already knew?</p>

<p>I know it sounds kinda dumb, but it is not that rare for me to realize something
that I had realized before, just never really thought about.</p>

<p>Like I remember one day I watched some Hatsune Miku concert, just one song, and
I realized there was a hologram, and I was like &quot;cool, they&#39;ve got a hologram&quot;.</p>

<p>Some months later I watched it again and I was like &quot;holy shit holograms!
Technology has gotten to that point!&quot;.</p>

<p>Just an example.</p>

<p>Another one would be how I made an entire CLI app just to download a Gist&#39;s
files and put them in the current directory.  Just yesterday I realized I can
just clone a Git repo of the Gist and that&#39;s that.  I was thinking that the .zip
file download was the only way to go, but it isn&#39;t.  I knew about the Git repo
stuff, I just never even registered it as an option.</p>

<p>Kinda short post, but just wanted to share that.</p>
