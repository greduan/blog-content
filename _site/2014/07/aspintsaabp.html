	<p>That&#39;s quite an obvious statement isn&#39;t it?  The one in the title.  Well
I didn&#39;t learn this until recently.</p>

<p>Let me explain myself, and how I&#39;m not dumb.</p>

<p>A small project you can get a skeleton for in like an hour, you spend a bit of
time brainstorming features and how you can simplify it and in an hour you have
a skeleton, in 15 mins you have a project ready to start working on, you&#39;ve
figured out the README the license etc., you just have to start making it now,
and that takes like 3 hours or less if you&#39;re good, depends on the project of
course.</p>

<p>In comparison, a big project you don&#39;t plan out quite as much, since that&#39;s
a bad idea to do at the start, instead you setup some tests (if you work Agile),
you make some decisions on what to start with etc.</p>

<p>After 5 hours, you&#39;re not nearly done with the big project, while the small
project you&#39;re at least halfway there if not done already.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re used to small projects, like I am, a bigger or slightly bigger project
may make you feel slow, at least it made me feel slow.</p>

<p>I just kinda want to say that&#39;s probably normal and not something to worry
about, if you haven&#39;t finished your idea in 6 months, maybe start worrying.  lol</p>
