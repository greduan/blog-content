	<p>Let me start off by saying that I&#39;m writing this at 23:00 in Switzerland&#39;s time,
so please forgive any stupidities. Usually I go to sleep at 22:00 or something
like that.  Really need to go to sleep for tomorrow...</p>

<p>Anyway.  I&#39;m going to be talking about WMs (Window Managers) in GNU/Linux, those
that can be found in Arch Linux.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: I went with <a href="http://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>, here&#39;s my config files:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad">https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad</a></p>

<p>So the TL;SR (Too Long; Still Read) version will start by me saying that I tried
almost, if not all of the WMs.  I can confidently say I&#39;m dissapoined there
isn&#39;t a single stacking WM that is keyboard controlled, besides the mouse.
That would be my ideal setup.  But there isn&#39;t, so I tried a lot of dynamic WMs.</p>

<p>A short list of those I tried is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>, I went with this one</li>
<li><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146889">Alopex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the most notable ones.  The ones that I honestly tried for a while and
can give a fair review or opinion for.</p>

<h2>Alopex</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s start with Alopex.  Alopex is the one I like the most after XMonad.  I&#39;ve
used it for at least... 2 or 3 months or something.</p>

<p>It is very nice, almost ideal, but it lacks the configurability I like.</p>

<h2>awesome</h2>

<p>Another one I really liked.  I used this one for... 1 or 2 weeks, give or take a
few.</p>

<p>I liked it but it&#39;s too heavy for me. Also I don&#39;t like Lua and the config seems
to change every single update, which isn&#39;t good IMO.</p>

<h2>BSPWM</h2>

<p>This is the one I was most excited for TBH, but I couldn&#39;t get Dzen2 to work
correctly with it so I had to give up. Super powerful window management though,
I suggest you try this one before XMonad.</p>

<h2>XMonad</h2>

<p>Finally XMonad.  The king of tiling WMs it seems.  Atleast for me.  What makes
XMonad unique for me is that it&#39;s written in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>,
the language I have my eye on, and that I&#39;m currently trying to learn, to a
degree, to see if I like it.</p>

<p>A config tutorial, tour whatever will come later in another blog post, in the
meanwhile just know I went with XMonad, and you can find my config files here: https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad</p>

<p>If there&#39;s something you think could be said better in this post or you find a
typo feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/the-world-of-window-managers.html.md">modify it</a>
and make a pull request for it!</p>
