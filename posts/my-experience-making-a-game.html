using Clojure as the language and using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS structure</a> for the code.</p>

<p>This will not be a &#8220;Hey I made Pong!&#8221; post. This is a real game that I will
develop and eventually (hopefully) make a profit from.</p>

<p>Some things to make clear. I did not know I was going to use Clojure for the
language or use an ECS structure for the code. This is what I arrived at after
lots of thinking and research.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping this post will be of useful insight to those that are considering
making game, especially if they&#8217;re making it using Clojure or the ECS
structure.</p>

<h2 id="decidingonthelanguage">Deciding on the language</h2>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t wake up and go &#8220;Clojure is the way to go.&#8221; It was several
weeks of me considering all the options that I considered fit for my needs.</p>

<p>The languages I considered were Go, C, C++, Common Lisp, JavaScript, Python and
a couple of others I think.</p>

<p>So why did I choose Clojure? Several reasons but the most obvious are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s Lisp. Can&#8217;t argue with that.</li>
<li>It compiles into JVM bytecode.</li>
<li>Rich Hickey is smart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the second point.</p>

<h3 id="itcompilesintojvmbytecode">It compiles into JVM bytecode</h3>

<p>So why is this a selling point?</p>

<p>It means my code is automatically cross platform (as long as the user has Java
installed on his computer).</p>

<p>It also means that I have access to all the libraries Java has.</p>

<p>Both of these reasons are big deciding factors. Write my code once with a huge
amount of libraries I can use if I wish.</p>

<p>Oh and I also have access to any help users have requested in the past for
Java.</p>

<h2 id="decidingonthearchitecture">Deciding on the architecture</h2>

<p>Once I decided I had to choose between OOP and ECS. This really wasn&#8217;t really
a hard decision.</p>

<p>I just had to understand how both worked pros and cons and stuff. However for
me the pros are much better for ECS.</p>

<p>This really came to me listening to my gut. This wasn&#8217;t a <em>really</em> logical
decision besides &#8220;go with it, you think better with it&#8221;.</p>

<p>And so far it&#8217;s been working pretty well. Onto more exciting stuff!</p>

<h2 id="learningclojure">Learning Clojure</h2>

<p>Yes, I decided I wanted to use Clojure before being able to speak in it, deal
with it.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t a bad experience. I&#8217;m familiar with the concept of lists and I like
it. I&#8217;m not uncomfortable with parentheses and brackets either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also a fast learner so I can learn from guessing the code I&#8217;m reading, as
long as I know the language basics.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://blackstag.com/blog.posting?id=5">Tim Robinson&#8217;s Clojure tutorial for beginners</a> in order to learn how
to read and write Clojure.</p></article></main></div><div id="footer"><footer role="contentinfo"><p><a href="https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/LICENSE.md" title="License Terms">License Terms</a>.
