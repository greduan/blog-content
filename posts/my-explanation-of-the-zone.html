A lot of programmers talk about &quot;the zone&quot;, this high performance mode that
programmers get into is one that the most pro of the athletes also seem to
experience.  It is described as a &quot;zone&quot; where the people that experience it are
just so concentrated that nothing distracts them and they can get great work
done very quickly.</p>
<p>Most scientists can&#39;t explain this and the best explanation I have seen of this
(IIRC) is that it&#39;s a result of &quot;time slowing down&quot;, where your senses just get
so sharp you can feel time slowing down, or so it is described.</p>
<p>You may notice I am mixing two kinds of &quot;zones&quot; here, the programmer&#39;s zone and
the athlete&#39;s zone, this is on purpose, you&#39;ll see later on why. </p>
<h2 id="hammock-driven-development">Hammock Driven Development</h2>
<p>So, I got thinking about this originally because of <a href="http://youtu.be/f84n5oFoZBc">Rich Hickey&#39;s Hammock
Driven Development</a>.  I got thinking about his
idea.  There is an excellent summary by the website <a href="http://data-sorcery.org/">Data Sorcery With
Clojure</a> which can be found here:
<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/">http://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/</a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the image:</p>
<p><img src="http://incanter.org/images/misc/hammock-driven-dev.png" alt="Hammock Driven Development cheatsheet"></p>
<p>Now.  I disagree with him partially.  I do not think it works that way, but
that&#39;s certainly seems to be the result.  So it works, but not for the right
reasons, you could say.</p>
<p>So Rich is right, partially.  Results, OK, reasons, nein (German no).</p>
<h2 id="my-theory-of-hammock-driven-development">My theory of Hammock Driven Development</h2>
<p>So how Rich explains it is that there&#39;s basically two minds.  Evaluation and
Preparation.  Probably don&#39;t go by these names in Rich&#39;s world, but you get the
idea.</p>
<p>Now here&#39;s where I disagree.  There&#39;s only one mind in my book, it just has
different priorities, now let me explain that cause it&#39;s not that simple.</p>
<h2 id="attention-units">Attention units</h2>
<p>For now assume attention units are just some kind of unit of concentration or
something, I&#39;ll explain it soon enough.</p>
<p>OK, so, here&#39;s my idea of how the mind actually works, in terms of the zone.
One mind, different priorities.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s say I&#39;m just standing still.  My mind at this point is doing all kinds
of shit.  Keeping track of bodily functions, breathing, blood pumping, all of
the organs that process food and stuff, recording perceptions and evaluating
them, keeping balance of the body.  All of this shit is happening real time,
often so quickly and so easily we don&#39;t pay much attention to it, but it&#39;s still
happening.  It is still doing all of that stuff.</p>
<p>Now, consider when you are sleeping or just relaxing.  A <em>lot</em> of these senses
are dulled or just completely shut down. When I&#39;m sleeping all that&#39;s happening
is breathing, blood pumping, and some bodily functions, but in general my body
is quiet. My senses are practically hibernating (in computer terms), just
awaiting the call that is &quot;I&#39;ve slept enough&quot; or some kind of waking up call, of
any kind.</p>
<p>Now, consider the mind&#39;s availability in both of these situations. In the first
it&#39;s busy, in the second it&#39;s got free time.  People often consider dreams as
just your mind processing and organizing the stuff that happened during the day,
that might very well be it entertaining itself, but that&#39;s another topic.</p>
<p>OK so now, what are attention units? Let&#39;s say you are... thinking about cats
with your eyes closed while sitting down or laying down.  Most of your attention
units are on the cats, that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking about, some are on perceptics
etc. There are also some on what you&#39;re going to eat next, mental memos, that
call you need to do right after thinking of cats etc.  Everything you have <em>any</em>
attention of <em>any</em> kind has some of your attention units.</p>
<p>Some people have more of these attention units at their disposal, because of
their environment, their natural &quot;talent&quot; (not my favorite word to be honest)
etc.</p>
<p>Now, according to Rich, all the problems we&#39;ve solved have been solved by the
Evaluation mind at some point, and while we consider ourselves smart because we
think of solutions fast it&#39;s just because at some point this problem had already
been solved by the Evaluation mind and you just need to call it back to your
Preparation mind. Rich is actually quite vague IIRC on this, but that&#39;s the
general idea AFAIK.</p>
<p>So here is my opinion, that&#39;s wrong.  It&#39;s one mind, just different priorities
at different times with different problems and different amounts of attention
units.  Turns out while sleeping it has more time to spend attention units on
your problem, thus solve it.</p>
<p>People that are good at maths (without being some sort of parrot) just have
attention units at their disposal... and practice.  They have these attention
units in order to have &quot;variables&quot; in their mind of number values that they need
to keep floating around.  Plus good mind processor.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not two minds, only one.</li>
<li>Mind has different priorities.</li>
<li>While sleeping the priorities are few, thus more time for your problems.</li>
<li>While awake, you can still solve problems from scratch, speed depends from
person to person...</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this depends <em>greatly</em> on the person. His emotional and mental status
and aptitude.</p>
<p>That&#39;s just my two cents, what&#39;s your opinion? Send me an email at
<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x65;&#100;&#x75;&#x61;&#110;&#x6c;&#x61;&#118;&#x61;&#x71;&#117;&#x65;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#x65;&#100;&#x75;&#x61;&#110;&#x6c;&#x61;&#118;&#x61;&#x71;&#117;&#x65;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a> and tell me all about it. :)</p>
<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> Forgot to talk about the zone.  Oops.  Basically, just <em>all</em> of your
attention units are on what matters to you, thus you have more time to think and
nothing distracts you since your attention units aren&#39;t on that.</p>
