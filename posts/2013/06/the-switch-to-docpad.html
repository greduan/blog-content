<p>Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.</p>

<p>I switched to <a href="http://docpad.org">DocPad</a>, the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> based static website generator. It&#8217;s a static website generator but if you wish it can be completely dynamic.</p>

<p>I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using <a href="http://coffeekup.org/">CoffeeKup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</a> as templating languages and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> for the JavaScript logic.</p>

<p>Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)</p>
