title: Several VLC interfaces

A couple of days ago I found out that VLC has several interfaces besides the
usual nice GUI interface.

In Arch Linux installing VLC also installs a couple of CLI interfaces for you.

For example it installs `nvlc`, which is an ncurses interface, which means you
don't need X11 to listen to that music or podcast or whatever.

It offers `cvlc`, which I don't know what it stands for but it allows you to
watch a video without the fancy GUI. So you do need X11 running but it doesn't
load the GUI and all that, just the video player and with some hotkeys
I imagine, when I pressed the spacebar it paused so maybe the rest work.

And of course it offers `vlc` which loads the normal VLC but you can give it
a path to the file or folder from the CLI.
