I dunno if you have experienced this in the past, but I know I have. It's a very curious thing indeed; Have you ever read something about technology or whatever field you are in, a month after you did so originally, and suddenly a lot of stuff makes a ton more sense?

<!--
Like for example, I read something about how RAM works or what RAM is. I sorta understand, I know it stands for "Random Access Memory" and that gives me an idea of what it does etc.

Then I'm reading about the motherboard a week later. There I learn what it does, why a good motherboard is good, what some ports are for, why they require a certain order to put the RAM in (if you don't fill all the slots).

Then I read about... I dunno the processor and then later the graphics card. And so on and so forth.

I see videos on the subject, read tons of posts etc. You know just have an interest in this stuff.

Then I decide I will read that first post about RAM. *All of a sudden*, I learn a TON more stuff from it. Oh OK, so "DDRn" in RAM is actually the speed at which it can transfer data. OK. Oh and it stands for "Double Data Rate". OK, cool. Oh OK, so the order of where you put the RAM matters because of how the motherboard connects it to the processor and stuff.

This is just an example, actually what really happened is I heard something, I looked it up cause I was curious and went on with my life. But then [this video by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ&index=5&list=FLicj4_k_90isv5i45zoK4Cg) completely cleared up for me WHY better parts are better, you know?

So my very clear reasoning for this is, you study something, OK got it, later when you study it again it's much clearer and obvious and you can think in it much better because now you have experience/more knowledge to link it to. So before it was a stray piece of info, now it's clear how it interacts with everything. Or something along those lines.

So anyway, read stuff you've read before, as long as you've learned other stuff of the same subject or you have been working with the same subject, stuff will make more sense and will be clearer in your head.
