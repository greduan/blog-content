So right from the get-go you know I disagree with this mind set of "out of
sight, out of mind". My titles are clever like that.

Anyway. First I'll start by saying. I do see the point. I understand that if
you're not seeing it then it may not even be a consideration. This is true for
stuff like... If you hire someone to take the trash out for you, suddenly you
don't care about the trash that you generate, because somebody else is doing it
for you.

But if that isn't the case. Then no matter what you do it's gonna be on your
mind. And here's where this idea breaks down.

It's great for services, like I clean the house. Eventually you're gonna forget
that it was even dirty, if I come daily.

Now what happens if... if you like your dog and it disappears. Even if it is out
of sight, it is not out of mind. I mean if you're a worrywart you're probably
sweating bullets just thinking about what could have happened to him.

I could give tons of examples, crappy ones probably, but the point is. Just
because it's not on your sight, it is in your mind. That's how the mind works.
You can't avoid the fact that you murdered someone just by hiding it in the
dumpster or something, you know?

Anyway, my point is, no matter what you do, it's gonna be on your mind if you
consider it not solved or not a closed thing.
