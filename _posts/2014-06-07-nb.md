My blog got a new URL! No longer hosted on GitHub pages, is is now being hosted
by my DigitalOcean server.

The way the website works now <http://greduan.com> is my index page where I put
links to some profiles and to my blog, which is available under
<http://blog.greduan.com>.

That is all. Hope you like the changes! This will certainly make it easier for
me to do stuff with my website.
