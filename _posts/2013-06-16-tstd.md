Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.

I switched to [DocPad](http://docpad.org), the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based static website generator. It's a static website generator but if you wish it can be completely dynamic.

I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using [CoffeeKup](http://coffeekup.org/) and [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) as templating languages and normal JavaScript for the `.js` files. And I am using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) for the CSS, of course.

Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that's cool.

That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)
