			<title>Light Table, The New Emacs</title>

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The title may be misleading so I&amp;#8217;m gonna make it clear right now. I couldn&amp;#8217;t
come up with anything better. It&amp;#8217;s gonna stay like that, so you can make
suggestions for a better title but I won&amp;#8217;t change the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me explain why I chose this title. That&amp;#8217;s what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a popular saying that Vim users love to use against Emacs users in the
holy editor wars. That saying is &amp;#8220;Emacs would make a great OS, if only it had a
good text editor.&amp;#8221; or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can sort of agree with that. Emacs&amp;#8217; editor is not superior to Vim&amp;#8217;s in
almost any front. But let&amp;#8217;s look at the bright side of that saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re criticizing the text editor. But they&amp;#8217;re acknowledging it as an OS. In
other words it apparently can be extended immensely. And it has proven to be
able to do just that. It has just about anything that can be done in text. Email
reader, news reader, chat, calendar, you name it. And if it isn&amp;#8217;t already
implemented, go ahead and do it yourself! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, it can be extended immensely towards developing. Debuggers, the
CLI, automatic compiling functionality, people have made it an IDE as well. So
its limits are practically none. Oh and let&amp;#8217;s not forget about the language
you use to customize it. Emacs Lisp, A.K.A. Elisp; Its own dialect of Lisp.
You can&amp;#8217;t get a lot more customizable than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except you can&amp;#8230; Enter Light Table!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lighttable.com/&quot;&gt;Light Table&lt;/a&gt; is one of the new kids on the block.
It is coded in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure.org/clojurescript&quot;&gt;ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;, a Lisp
dialect that essentially compiles to JS. The other new kid is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/limetext/lime&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;, but he still hasn&amp;#8217;t got a working
frontend (at the time of writing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-granger.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Granger&lt;/a&gt; (the main dev of Light Table) has
created a unique architecture with Light Table. (As I understand it) you can add
or remove anything and everything. Well maybe not everything since you&amp;#8217;ll always
want some stuff there but you know what I mean. Think about the ECS (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system&quot;&gt;Entity
Component System&lt;/a&gt;), that&amp;#8217;s
almost &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what Light Table has as an architecture. It is the first text
editor of its kind in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has created a very interesting system with Light Table where the basic text
editor is loaded by default. All of the text editor you get by default are just
behaviours. These behaviours can be added, removed, disabled, enabled. I&amp;#8217;m sure
you get where I&amp;#8217;m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be anything and everything with due time! It could be the first real
competitor for Emacs as well in terms of customizability. Think about it, it&amp;#8217;s
written in ClojureScript, a Lisp dialect, you can add or remove behaviours, to
the point where you can make it a NotePad or a browser if you liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JS is its limit. If you can&amp;#8217;t do it with JS (and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;) you can&amp;#8217;t do it in Light Table. But if you can
do it in JS you can do it in Light Table. JS is quickly becoming the one
language to write. JS is found almost everywhere nowadays. So I think Chris has
made a smart decision when he decided to write it in ClojureScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point is, it&amp;#8217;s got (almost) no limit on what can be added &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; no
limit on what can be removed, something Emacs is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and one more thing. Emacs is millions of lines of Elisp plus the C code it
uses. Light Table is only around twelve thousand lines of ClojureScript, at the
time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess you get my point. If you don&amp;#8217;t yet, there&amp;#8217;s not much I can do so I
really hope you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s something you think could be said better in this post feel free to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/light-table-the-new-emacs.html.md&quot;&gt;modify it&lt;/a&gt;
and make a pull request for it!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Open Source Games Without Going Poor</title>
			<link href="http://greduan.github.io/posts/open-source-games-without-going-poor.html"/>

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Release your game for a fee, after a certain amount of time release
source code, continue selling pre-compiled version to public. Open source
games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the idea? What do I mean with open source games?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love open source. I try to make everything I use open source whenever
possible. There are lot of great projects I use and sometimes contribute to
that are open source. For example Clojure, Vim, Chromium (all of which I use)
or DocPad (to which I contribute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love games, I mean who doesn&amp;#8217;t? Doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be video games for it
to be a game, there&amp;#8217;s also physical games like Tag, Hide-and-Seek etc. They are
all free, open source, they&amp;#8217;re just an idea, you see kids modifying games in
order to make them more interesting all the time! Most video games aren&amp;#8217;t open
source however. You pay for a game, you play it, finish it (or complete it),
move on to the next game. The games that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; open source are so simple there
isn&amp;#8217;t any gain in making them not open source, if anything you lose from making
them closed source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of, if not all developers love open source. However, a lot of us
developers make games for a living. We can&amp;#8217;t make them open source, we would
have to live off of donations, which are inconsistent if there are donations
and if there aren&amp;#8217;t well&amp;#8230; we&amp;#8217;re in deep shit if we don&amp;#8217;t have a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is an idea I had that tries to solve that. Us open source lovers who
want to make a decent living off of making &lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt; games will be able to
do this with this idea I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, release the game to the public for a fee as usual, however
after an agreed amount of time which you decide release the game&amp;#8217;s source. Make
it open source. However, continue selling the pre-compiled game to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s really a simple idea. You release the game for a fee for a certain
amount of time in order to make a living or at least make up for what you lost
in the development process. After that certain amount of time is up you release
the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the game open source however you are still making an income from
non-techie users or just nice users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would this work? Smart users would just wait a year or whatever and
compile the source and done, they won&amp;#8217;t pay anything, why would they? They&amp;#8217;re
&lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; about it. This idea is just a recipe for disaster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the way I see it, if your game is good enough, people won&amp;#8217;t care about
paying for it. They won&amp;#8217;t mind keeping you alive by giving you $5 or whatever
your game costs. In fact they would be glad that you made that game. AND, as an
added bonus, if they&amp;#8217;re interested in the game&amp;#8217;s source code to see how you
figured out this holy-crap-that-looks-crazy thing in your game, they can do
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most probably if the don&amp;#8217;t pay for your game it&amp;#8217;s because they want some sort
of trial period or they can&amp;#8217;t even afford the game anyway. So really you&amp;#8217;re not
losing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;#8217;ll be the users that just compile the game, play it, finish
and complete it and uninstall it, never touching it again. How many users are
like that? In my experience with people, not many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a trust issue. Do you trust your users enough to be nice enough to
let you live? Or not? I trust them, they&amp;#8217;re playing my awesome game, why
wouldn&amp;#8217;t they want to keep me alive for me to make more games?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at it the other way, maybe people are interested in your game not
for the game itself, but the code. They approach your game&amp;#8217;s code because you
figured something out that they&amp;#8217;ve had a hard time figuring out. They figure
out stuff for you that you did wrong and make pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have an income one way or another. Be it through code or money. If they
help with the code they help with the overall game so the sales would be
better, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a crazy but not impossible idea I had while thinking on my bed, so
it&amp;#8217;s not really fleshed out, since there isn&amp;#8217;t anything to flesh out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also it&amp;#8217;s kinda hastily written, so if there&amp;#8217;s something you think could be
said better in this post feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/open-source-games-without-going-poor.html.md&quot;&gt;modify it&lt;/a&gt; and make a pull request
for it!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>The Switch to DocPad</title>

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;http://docpad.org&quot;&gt;DocPad&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; based static website generator.
It&amp;#8217;s a static website generator but if you wish it can be completely dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeekup.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeKup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/eco&quot;&gt;Eco&lt;/a&gt; as
templating languages and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; for the JavaScript logic. And I am
using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt; for the CSS, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>
