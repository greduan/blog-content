<p>I just want to point out this blog is more like a brain dump. Don't take anything I say here seriously. Seriously, don't.</p>

<p>FYI, this blog is being used to practice my writing skills and as I said above, to brain dump, so you <em>may</em> notice an improvement as my writing goes on.</p>

<ul class="posts">
	{% for post in site.posts %}
	<li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
