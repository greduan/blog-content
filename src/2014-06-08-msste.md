I'm going to come out and say that I like Emacs.  As a platform, not as an
editor mind you.

I am using [Evil][evil] as is probably to be expected.  I have become so
accustomed to Vim that without some sort of Vim emulation I cannot survive in
another editor.

This is why I'm using Evil and I am slowly, but surely, using Emacs more and
more, making little modifications that make it nicer and and more comfortable
for me.  I'll soon probably have to write a couple of plugins in order to
achieve some Vim behaviour I like though, that'll be fun.

So I just wanted to share that. If I ever need to use Vim in a remote server or
for pair programming, I'm open and if I need to use Emacs I'm also open, unless
it's Emacs without Evil, in which case I am closed.

I have NO clue how Emacs users could use `C-f` for moving right by one, `C-b`
for back one, `C-n` to move down one and `C-p` to go up one.  It's crazy, their
hands move ALL OVER the keyboard, and they say it's fine.  Whoever says that is
either bored or crazy or both.  Or something.
