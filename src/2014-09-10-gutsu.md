title: Getting used to software updates

I noticed that some years ago I used to seriously look forward to every update
that any software I was using got.  Like I'd read all the changelogs and I'd be
constantly checking to make sure there wasn't an update to some piece of
software that didn't update itself.

That's also a reason I got into Arch in the first place I think, besides the
minimalism and how I like to build my environment from the ground up.  The
reason being that it has a rolling release model, so all of my software is as
up-to-date as it can be.  Almost, I mean it doesn't go into betas, just into
every "stable" release according to the piece of software.

I think using Linux, specifically Arch Linux, for several years now has
desensitised me to software updates.  Where now I I don't look at *every*
update, instead I look at major updates, updates to the browser, to my text
editors, etc.  Stuff of which you have to be aware because a lot has changed
since you last used it, those kind of changes.

Just thought I would document that I guess, there's not more to this blog post.
