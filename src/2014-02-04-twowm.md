**Note from 2015: Nowadays I don't use any of these except bspwm and/or 2bwm
sometimes, nowadays I use swm+wmutils or something really simple like that.**

Let me start off by saying that I'm writing this at 23:00 in Switzerland's time,
so please forgive any stupidities.  Usually I go to sleep at 22:00 or something
like that.  Really need to go to sleep for tomorrow...

Anyway.  I'm going to be talking about WMs (Window Managers) in GNU/Linux, those
that can be found in Arch Linux.

TL;DR: I went with [XMonad][x] for reasons.

[x]: http://xmonad.org

So the TL;SR (Too Long; Still Read) version will start by me saying that I tried
almost, if not all of the WMs.  I can confidently say I'm dissapoined there
isn't a single stacking WM that is keyboard controlled, besides the mouse.
That would be my ideal setup.  But there isn't, so I tried a lot of dynamic WMs.

A short list of those I tried is the following:

- [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/), I went with this one
- [Alopex](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146889)
- [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/)

Those are the most notable ones.  The ones that I honestly tried for a while and
can give a fair review or opinion for.

## Alopex

Let's start with Alopex.  Alopex is the one I like the most after XMonad.  I've
used it for at least... 2 or 3 months or something.

It is very nice, almost ideal, but it lacks the configurability I like.

## awesome

Another one I really liked.  I used this one for... 1 or 2 weeks, give or take a
few.

I liked it but it's too heavy for me.  Also I don't like Lua and the config
seems to change every single update, which isn't good IMO.

## BSPWM

This is the one I was most excited for TBH, but I couldn't get Dzen2 to work
correctly with it so I had to give up.  Super powerful window management though,
I suggest you try this one before XMonad.

## XMonad

Finally XMonad.  The king of tiling WMs it seems.  Atleast for me.  What makes
XMonad unique for me is that it's written in [Haskell][h], the language I have
my eye on, and that I'm currently trying to learn, to a degree, to see if I like
it.

[h]: https://www.haskell.org/

This is the one I went with because of reasons.
