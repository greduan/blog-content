If you have no idea what Object-based JavaScript is, here are three *awesome*
blog posts by Kyle Sympson.  You will not regret it.

- [JS Objects: Inherited a Mess](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects)
- [JS Objects: Distractions](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects-distractions)
- [JS Objects: De"construct"ion](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects-deconstruction)

Here I am going to talk about design patterns, while those blog posts explain
the idea of Object-based JS, they don't go into much detail of how you would
replace Prototype-based designs.  I'll be giving examples of both OB
(Object-based) and PB (Prototype-based).

## Prototype-based

Let's start with what most people are familiar.  Here's a simple "class" that
you can instantiate:

``` javascript
var Class = function () {
  // some code to run when initialised
}

var classInstance = new Class()
```

We've seen this before.  It's the most common way to instantiate stuff in JS.
This is fine, but we're not using plain objects.  So let's see the way to do it
with plain objects.
