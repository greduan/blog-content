Yay I made another part of my website! :D

Just thought at some point something like this might come in handy so I made
this website.

Can be found here: <http://projects.greduan.com>

It is also found in the list of links in my home page.

It doesn't have all of my projects, as you may notice, but it is a list of those
that I personally think would benefit others and that are standalone from
another application, like DocPad or MetalSmith.

Of course this list may change and also the requirements that I have for me to
put them on there, but we'll see...
