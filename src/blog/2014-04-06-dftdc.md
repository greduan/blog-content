So this is something like an official announcement.  The original announcement
can be found on this GitHub issue:
<https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/821#issuecomment-38612150>

That's it. I'm super lazy so I'm just linking to the original. lol

EDIT:

This no longer applies. Ben has found a way to reignite my interest in it.  And
since now I spend much more time in Node.js DocPad is a big focus point for me.
