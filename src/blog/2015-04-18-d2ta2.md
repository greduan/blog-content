So first of all, I'm sorry that I haven't written any blog posts in the last few
months.  I don't need to apologize, but I feel like doing it.  If you felt you
deserved an apology, I don't see why but I already apologized, so there.

OK so I'm just gonna give you a quick update of what's happened in these months.

Baiscally, in December I started a move which didn't end until the 26th of
December or something like that.  During that time I had no internet, why?
Cause I had messed up my Arch Linux install, but I didn't have time to
reinstall, so yeah I was stuck without internet or a laptop for almost a month.

Then the first of January of 2015 or something like that I got internet access.
I spent one week debating whether I should install Arch again (cause I was tired
of it) or if I should go with something new.  I wanted to install *BSD but I had
trouble so in the end I went with the [CRUX][c] Linux distro.

So I've been using CRUX for 4 months, until yesterday when I installed OpenBSD.

Today I've been having fun discovering OpenBSD.  I'll soon have a blog post
about my experience with OpenBSD.
