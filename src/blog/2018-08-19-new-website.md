So there's a new website and blog, in both design and engine.

So the basic changes are:

- https://projects.greduan.com no longer exists.  Didn't offer value.
- https://blog.greduan.com is now https://greduan.com/blog
- https://greduan.com/gpg-pub-key.txt is now https://greduan.com/gpg
- New design!  Less CSS.  Less [web obesity crisis][web-obesity].  I wasn't
    particularly contributing to it before anyway, but now it's even less, and
    I'm getting a taste for this simple aesthetic anyway.
- New me!  Which means different topics, different writing styles, and much
    more JS expertise.
- The website is no longer open source.  That did not actually provide much
    value and was a bit of a PITA, somehow.
    - The content license can now be easily read at https://greduan.com/license
- No longer hosted on DigitalOcean (which was hella fast) using nginx, now
    hosted on [Now][now] using simple [Fastify][fastify] server. Makes for much
    easier deployments and site management.

In case you're wondering, nowadays (at time of writing) I work for a company
called [Impala][impala], in the hotel PMS industry.  If you're in that industry,
I am sure we're of interest.  I work full time remote, which is quite nice.

Nowadays I live in Grenchen, Switzerland, the year before that I lived in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Look forward to new content (hopefully!).  I'll be talking about hopefully more
valuable topics than *just* my experience with stuff.
