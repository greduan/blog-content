<p>If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my email account <a href="mailto:eduanlavaque@gmail.com">eduanlavaque@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to request me as a freelancer please include “Freelancer: “ at the start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your email:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your first and last names.</li>
	<li>The email to which I should send the answer to.</li>
	<li>Your budget, i.e. how much you <em>can</em> pay me for this job.</li>
	<li>The description of what you want/need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me as a freelancer is that you aren’t a <a href="http://clientsfromhell.net/">Client From Hell</a> (no offense).</p>

<p>Another thing, while I can certainly guarantee that my work will be high quality, I cannot guarantee it’ll be done in time if you give me a short timespan to do it in, since I won't even start! :P I prefer quality over quantity in anything and everything, including my work. And I don’t like time limits, at all. So if you give me a very short time limit, don't expect me to accept please. :)</p>
