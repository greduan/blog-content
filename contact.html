<p>If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my email account eduan [at] websharks-inc [dot] com.</p>

<p>If you want to request me as a freelancer please include "Freelancer: " at the start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your email:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your first and last names.</li>
	<li>The email to which I should send the answer to.</li>
	<li>Your budget, i.e. how much you <em>can</em> pay me for this job.</li>
	<li>The description of what you want/need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me as a freelancer is that you aren't a <a href="http://clientsfromhell.net/">Client From Hell</a> (no offense).</p>
